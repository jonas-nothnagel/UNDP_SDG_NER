The OIC call to action will offer grants between US$50,000 and $250,000 to scalable, replicable and transferable innovations that advance progress on SDG 14 targets.

The first planned interventions will focus on reducing pollution from plastic and nutrients as called for in SDG target 14.1. Preliminary concepts can be submitted on the Ocean Innovation Challenge website.

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner called the OIC “a most welcome addition to the growing number of ocean incubators and accelerators,” and highlighted that “to achieve SDG14, we must break new ground with innovative technologies, policies, regulations and financial instruments.”

The OIC also intends to accelerate progress in advance of the 2020 High-Level UN Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14 to be held in June as well as the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development set to commence in 2021.

His announcements included the co-facilitators he has appointed for several processes: preparations for the Biodiversity Summit, preparations for the Second Ocean Conference, preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary, and the intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

3,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/2020s-buzzword-is-nature/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: 2020's Buzzword is Nature,"The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending. Relatable, universal, and cross-cutting, Nature will be a dominant and uniting theme for many of the milestone events leading up to the adoption of a new, post-2020 framework for biodiversity in October.

With half of humanity living in urban areas, where biodiversity often comes in the forms of roaches, rats, monkeys, and mosquitoes, any push to save the planet needs a concept everyone can embrace. The messaging this year will be broad and it will be accessible. From slum to skyscraper, Nature is all around. Air to breathe, fresh water and food. A stunning sunset. A vicious storm. Nature envelopes us, and for better or worse, it ‘leaves no one behind.’ Communications will encourage the reconnection of people to Nature, like for instance the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ (IPBES) emphasis on ‘Nature’s Contributions to People.’

Going into 2020, data show that we won’t achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Aichi Targets by their deadline in December. Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May. Last year, the IPBES Global Assessment of the State of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service report, which will serve as the scientific basis of the post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations, informed that approximately a million species are a risk of extinction and that nature continues to decline due to human activities. The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.

Perhaps a wider and softer net – one woven by Mother Nature herself – can help. Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies. This has long been a CBD priority, with the Convention dedicating its 2018 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors – recognizing that these sectors depend on nature’s contributions. Without a doubt, the plight of biodiversity must be universally understood and addressed, if humanity is to solve the ecological crisis. As the 2019 World Economic Forum, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund are saying, it’s time for a “New Deal for Nature.”

Further, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation has demanded an end to siloed development approaches and encouraged a focus on the linkages between the environmental, economic and social aspects of development. No more is biodiversity to be considered in a vacuum – not if it is to be truly integrated into the universally agreed, global development platform. Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework. Nature’s systems, of which biodiversity is a critical component, sustain life on Earth and offer a touchstone for the achievement of all the Goals. Nature is cross-cutting.

The theme for biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity.

When the CBD does convene its COP in October to adopt the post-2020 biodiversity framework, it will do so under the theme of ‘Ecological Civilizations: Building a Shared Future for all Life on Earth.’ Note that the theme for the biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity. Instead it links people (civilizations) to nature (ecology). Ecology is the branch of biology dealing with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. By its theme, the CBD COP won’t just be talking about conserving biodiversity for biodiversity’s sake. It will be talking about the core of humanity – our civilizations – and their relationship to the natural world all around. It is an approach that strikes an additional nail into the coffin of siloed approaches to conservation.

The other major biodiversity-related COP in 2020, that of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in February, will also have ecology at the heart of its theme. For its part, the CMS will present the concept of ‘Ecological Connectivity,’ which it defines as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.” With a concept that links the migration of species to the sustenance of all life on Earth, the CMS is calling for both an Ecological Connectivity stand-alone target as well as integration of the concept into other relevant targets of the new biodiversity framework.’ Will the bigger pictures sync? Can our “ecological civilizations” be “ecologically connected”?

In addition to ecology, nature-based solutions are also likely to feature in the big biodiversity-related and climate meetings this year. These approaches, which offer a linked way to incorporate biodiversity considerations into multidimensional development problems, rose to global attention in 2019. They were stressed in parallel to the Climate Action Summit, especially with regard to forests, as well as at the UN Convention on Desertification COP (UNCCD COP 14) and the High-level Panel on Oceans, during Climate Week. Nature-based solutions have been framed as a way to address multiple priorities at once – for instance mangroves offer protection from climate-related disasters like storm surges, while fostering the biodiversity that supports fisheries (food and employment) and sequestering carbon.

In announcing the theme of the next World Environment Day, which will take place in June 2020 and focus on biodiversity, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, “2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action.” It is likely that nature-based solutions will also receive attention at the forthcoming meetings of the World Conservation Congress, the second UN Ocean Conference, and the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

As a final point of reference for the 2020 word of the year, when world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they will have an opportunity to participate in a ‘Nature Summit.’ The meeting will offer one more step towards achieving the CBD’s long-term (2050) Vision of ‘Living in Harmony with Nature.’

We are all touched by her hand, and for the Biodiversity Super Year, we will see that our hope lies in Nature.","The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending.

The compendium features country case studies from Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru.

The ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems’ was launched at the Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration, which took place from 14-18 October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. In September 2019, a synthesis report of the six case studies was introduced at a side event during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

One billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation.

According to the compendium, current birth registration coverage is not adequate to meet SDG target 16.9, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. It reports that: the average birth registration rate globally is 73%; only 46% children in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered; and only 25% of the world population live in countries where more than 90% of the births and deaths are registered, most of these countries being high-income countries. The authors also note that according to the latest data from the World Bank, 1 billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation. The World Bank has also found that approximately 50% of the world’s deaths are not registered.

The compendium aims to provide evidence and raise awareness of the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management, where civil registration and identity management systems support each other. The publication is also aimed at shedding light, for civil registration authorities, of the opportunities for advancing CRVS and increasing registration coverage through tighter cooperation or integration with identity management systems and other “identity ecosystem” actors.

The compendium focuses on the experiences of six countries that have pursued a holistic approach to CRVS: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru. The case studies reflect varied experiences in building identity ecosystems with different constitutional and legal systems, administrative traditions and institutional arrangements. The studies present good practices, underlining how the countries’ different starting points were not an obstacle to building their identity system around a holistic approach, as well as their various ways of working.

Five recurring messages were identified across the six case studies:

A strong CRVS system that registers all vital events from birth until death for the whole population is an essential precondition for the implementation of a holistic identity system;

Other components of an identity ecosystem, including the issuance of identification credentials and functional government systems, rely on civil registration records as the only source of up-to-date identity data;

The digitization of CRVS and identity management systems, together with other government functional systems, enables more efficient ways for processing identity information;

The benefits of a holistic approach span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption and leaving no one behind; and

The four key elements essential to a conducive enabling environment for pursuing a holistic identity system are: political commitment; a legal framework that enables data sharing; a data privacy and protection framework; and technology ownership from the outset to mitigate possible vendor lock-in.

The six case studies (Armenia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru) also show that technical interoperability provides a range of benefits in ensuring that all categories of population from birth to death reflect their identity information in the system.

5,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/escwa-reports-on-progress-on-sdg-7-in-arab-region/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ESCWA Reports on Progress on SDG 7 in Arab Region,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) has published a report tracking progress made on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) at the regional and country levels through the indicators of energy access, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).

The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.

According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.

The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.

However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.

The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:

equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;

ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;

update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;

strengthen regional cooperation; and

promote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.

The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities.

6,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/plans-outlined-for-sdg-moment-decade-of-action/,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Plans Outlined for SDG Moment, Decade of Action","UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed briefed UN Member States on plans for the UN’s ‘Decade of Action’ for SDG implementation and the annual ‘SDG moments’ that will begin in September 2020.

At an informal briefing on 19 December 2019, Mohammed recalled that the September 2019 high-level week had “provided a wake-up call” that efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda are not reaching the needed scale to bring about the “deep transformative change” required. The Decade of Action is an opportunity to course-correct, she said, noting that it is a priority for the Secretary-General, with “special amplification around climate action and gender equality.”

Mohammed highlighted three specific needs for the Decade of Action, noting that the plans follow consultations “across the system and with stakeholders from civil society, business, the arts, academia and beyond.” The first need is to rethink the narrative about the connection between the SDGs and the issues that young people care about, and to pursue the right communication strategies. These include harnessing the power of the media, community leaders and local influencers, strengthening engagement with national parliaments, business and local governments, and developing new relationships.

The second area for action during the Decade is to raise ambition. Among the ways to do this, Mohammed highlighted:

Strengthen nationally determined contributions on climate change action (NDCs) at the 2020 session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26) in Glasgow, UK;

Demonstrate commitment and increased ambition in the context of international meetings in 2020 on gender equality, biodiversity, the ocean and sustainable transport;

Review national development plans and financing frameworks to ensure the needed magnitude of change; and

Translate existing SDG engagement by businesses, cities, and the finance community into clear and measurable action.

Mohammed also noted the upcoming reviews of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), saying the reviews could yield a “new wave of voluntary national reviews” (VNRs). A new approach to the VNRs, she indicated, could showcase the milestones governments will pursue between now and 2030.

Finally, the Deputy Secretary-General underlined the need for solutions that deliver concrete results for those most in need, in particular solutions that catalyze progress on multiple SDGs at the same time. She said the Decade of Action will prioritize such solutions. Some examples are: improving renewable energy-related battery technology; increasing access to finance for climate-vulnerable countries; removing fossil fuel subsidies; and creating a new consensus on sustainable food. Mohammed said the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) will provide inspiration for these solutions through its “entry points” for transformative change. The Decade of Action also will build on the UN Secretary-General’s Strategy on Financing the 2030 Agenda, she said.

On the SDG moment, Mohammed reminded participants that the political declaration of the SDG Summit calls for an SDG moment to take place annually during the high-level week of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), each September until 2030. She said the Moment will highlight successes and identify where more action is needed. It is expected to:

Provide a snapshot of what is and is not working, where more action is needed, how to do so. This component will draw on data, analytics, innovation and technology.

Showcase the best SDG solutions that have been adopted by governments and other stakeholders.

Keep SDGs at top of political agenda, to complement the engagement and analysis conducted by the annual sessions of the HLPF.

The first SDG moment will take place in September 2020, either in conjunction with the high-level meeting to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary, on 21 September, or on the opening day of the UNGA’s general debate for the 75th session, on 22 September.

In a significant improvement over the inaugural version, 68 indicators have been directly borrowed from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework (NIF) while another 20 are modified versions of NIF indicators and 12 have been developed by NITI Aayog in consultation with Union ministries. This alignment of indicators will pave the way for better coordination among government agencies for tracking India’s performance on SDGs.

Another noteworthy improvement is the broader coverage of goals, targets and indicators. While in the first edition, Goals 12, 13 and 14 were not included, only Goal 17 has been left out of the second round for ranking sub-national governments due to the absence of any relevant indicators in the NIF. Additionally, while SDGII 2018 covered 39 targets and 62 indicators, SDGII 2019 spans 54 targets and 100 indicators.

Scores improve

So, how are we faring in our quest for achieving the SDGs? Overall, India’s score has improved from 57 to 60, with notable progress on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9 and 11. While, a decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio has contributed to our improved performance in the area of ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, ramping up toilet coverage under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan has raised the country’s score on ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’.

The commendable performance on Goal 7 is due to expanded access to clean cooking fuel and the government’s massive electrification drive. Similarly, on Goal 9, the progress can be attributed largely to a significant improvement in rural road connectivity and increased mobile phone penetration. Our performance on Goal 11 has been boosted by better access to housing through the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana as well as more widespread adoption of door-to-door waste collection and processing.

While this progress is heartening, there are certain indicators where focussed attention is required. For instance, India’s tuberculosis notification rate is still high, thus limiting our overall progress on Goal 3. Further, there are some SDGs on which the whole country needs to step up its performance considerably, namely those pertaining to poverty, hunger, gender and climate action.

Limitations exist

While SDGII 2019 is a much-improved version, an exercise of this nature is not without its limitations, especially because of the gaps in data availability. In subsequent versions of the Index continued efforts need to be made to include indicators that capture the full extent of the SDGs. For instance, if the target is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, we need to go beyond measuring spousal violence and sexual crimes against children. Similarly, SDG 3 must capture at least one indicator that reflects the country’s progress on tackling non-communicable diseases.

Crucially, concerted efforts need to be made to generate data disaggregated by gender, age and socio-economic status to truly get a sense of how we are faring in terms of fulfilling the overarching SDG mantra of ‘leaving no one behind’.

Finally, future SDG Index reports could perhaps go a step further by including good practices that enable high-performing States/UTs to make progress on each of the goals, thus providing useful lessons for those lagging behind.

India is the only country to publicly rank its sub-national governments on SDGs. While the exercise needs strengthening in terms of scope and quality on an ongoing basis, it is a valuable effort that needs to be persisted with as it helps to bring the SDG agenda into the limelight at the national level as well facilitates its localisation at the level of States and UTs.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

The Peru study reports that after operating a disperse system of civil registration and an identification system closely tied to electoral purposes for more than 100 years, in 1993 Peru established a single national agency in charge of both functions, el Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil (RENIEC). Since then, RENIEC has articulated a decentralized system, increasing the coverage of vital events registration, identifying citizens, and integrating CRVS and identity management systems. The integration was realized through establishing standard processes and guidelines, introducing digital technology, and digitizing civil registration and identification records.

Throughout the integration process, RENIEC has increased collaboration between public and private organizations through the exchange of data, and has become Peru’s primary resource for identity authentication. The case study notes that, in order to make civil registration the backbone of identity management, RENIEC focused its efforts on:

Constitutional independence and autonomy;

Digitized records;

Information exchange between public and private sectors;

Integration strategies combined with information technology; and

Online services at health facilities for birth and death certification and registration.

To reflect the benefits of CRVS and ID management, the publication highlights the example of nutrition subsidies where the integration improved service provision and saved time and money: RENIEC has ensured that more newborns get nutrition support in time by reducing the application process from two months to 72 hours, and reaching 71% of beneficiaries within the first month, up from 36%.

As data gaps in registration still remain, especially related to the most vulnerable segments of the population, RENIEC has taken measures to improve services for Indigenous communities, set inter-institutional alliances and cooperation, and launch mobile registration units.

The publication also notes that, as part of the efforts to serve Indigenous communities, the Identity Restitution and Social Support Department is developing a project to provide customized training to civil registrars in Indigenous communities. As Peru has 48 Indigenous languages that are spoken by approximately 16% of the population, since 2014 RENIEC has worked to promote the use of Indigenous languages in civil registration services. The institution also provides an online registration platform, civil registry books, civil registration forms, dissemination and training material, and certified copies of civil registration records in Indigenous languages. These measures have helped reduce registration errors, promote inclusion, reduce under-registration, and contribute to reaching the SDG target 16.9.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia and Netherlands. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the publication, Armenia’s experience shows that the two building blocks of identity – CVRS and identity management – do not need to operate under one agency to be done successfully, but can work well even if different agencies are responsible, as long as the respective systems are interoperable so they can share information.

The case study highlights how the country’s Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for civil registration, and the Police have developed “a solid framework” for working together. The publication notes that Armenia’s modern CRVS is fully digitized, with all registered information being entered directly into the electronic civil register. This system enables the digital vital events records that belong to a specific person to be linked, so their up-to-date identity information is available any time. The identity management system is managed by the police, its population register being an electronic database that serves as the main tool to manage identity data and issue national ID cards and travel documents.

The country study also reports that each time a new birth is added to the civil register, the information that includes identity attributes of the newborn is automatically sent to the population register, where a new personal record is created. Also, every time a new vital event is registered and the names of informants are added to the civil register, this digitized platform automatically pulls identity information for the informants from the population register. This way, the publication explains, the two interoperable systems can provide up-to-date information to other users of identity data from these registers.

Some of the good practices identified in the Armenia case study include:

Digitizing civil registration processes to enable easier data sharing and registration of vital events;

Including an e-health platform that can be accessed at hospitals, where digital and paper-based medical certificates are produced;

Linking the civil and population registers electronically to the civil register to copy identity data of informants or applicants from the population register, instead of copying that data from an identification credential that a person presents; and

Using an innovative platform to verify if civil registration certificates and documents are authentic.

The publication highlights data interoperability among government-operated information and communications technology systems as essential to the effectiveness of the holistic approach taken with regards to the CRVS and identity management systems, as it allows the government to decide which types of data each service can access. The text explains that when a nation-wide layer of data interoperability was added, specific procedures were instituted to regulate cooperation between the two agencies.

Overall, Armenia’s framework to fully digitize government services by 2030 focuses on cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, government efficiency, tech-oriented private sector, and tech-savvy workforce. According to the framework, once the proposed E-Gov is fully in place, it will reduce the cost of government services by 50%, significantly reduce corruption and increase competitiveness, and add up to 3% to the growth rate of Armenia’s gross domestic product.

According to the case study, like most countries that emerged from the former Soviet Union, Armenia inherited a well-developed system for registering vital events, thus investment was needed for the system’s digitization, which was done with support from the EU. The total amount invested in digitizing so far is estimated at around USD 2 million, with the digitizing of historical records being estimated at USD 1 for each vital event record.

The Sustainable Development goals data are based on 17 broad goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 2015.

India’s SDG Index is based on Qualitative Assessment which considers measuring the progress in all the States and Union Territories of India.

The SDG India Index was made in association with the United Nations of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and the Global Green Growth Institute. The UN-SDG Index is a part of the United Nations Resolution to be achieved by 2030.

However, the reports released by NITI Aayog seem to be inefficient and inaccurate as per the UN Index. So it will itself be a question of progress when the report itself inefficient. Let’s see how the report is inefficient and what is lacking behind the scenes.

Why India’s SDG Report 2019-20 Is Not So ‘Standardised’ As Per The UN Index

The SDG India Reports do not consider at all the Index as set by the United Nations for Indexing the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations has developed and finalized 232 Indicators for measuring SDGs which comes under the 17 broad goals as set by the UN. All the member nations should use 232 indicators for fair treatment and indexing. However, NITI Aayog only used 100 of these, which are 40% of the indicators in total.

Though the NITI Aayog’s vision has been modified and customised according to their own purposes, the standard monitoring approach should not be ignored especially when are treating and preparing nation wise data. The current report doesn’t seem to in line with the UN Indicators as all factors are not considered in the SDGs.

That’s why India’s SDG Index seems to be unstandardised and inefficient both. The concept and reports both are incomplete because there is reduction in indicators. Therefore, considering only 100 indicators instead of the proposed 232 indicators is inappropriate as well as misleading.

What Could NITI Aayog Have Done To Make The SDGs More Appropriate?

The Centre-driven organisation could have considered the whole indicators which making Sustainable Development Goals Report. This could have given a more specific detailed report on all the parameters.

On the other hand, these reports can be used to measure the country’s state and UT performances on these scales. In this way, the country will become able to take the right steps to achieve the goals as announced by the United Nations in the 2015 General Assembly.

The Current Reports Of India’s SDG Index

According to India’s SDG Index for 2019-20, Kerala stood top among the countries whereas Bihar, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh are in the bottom list. While seeing the data, Himachal Pradesh stood at 69 whereas Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh achieved 67 out of 100 in the recent SDG Index.

Here’s a report:

Conclusion

The current reports and analysis may not be counted as an appropriate one as it does not take into consideration the standards as set by the UN. It doesn’t matter if the indicators are worth or not, but ignoring and cutting short them can lead to inefficient reports.

The reports should have been prepared on the basis of total indicators as set up by the UN to maintain uniformity and check the country’s status on all ground indicators.

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

The document – Frontier 2030 – is aimed at ensuring the application of information technology in achieving the SDGs set up by the United Nations for the year 2030.

""To help close the gap between technology's potential and the slow rate of progress, the Forum is supporting the launch of Frontier 2030 at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos,"" said WEF in a media statement on Thursday. The Frontier 2030 would be a roadmap to mobilize technology companies, governments, international organizations, investors and civil society to tackle the barriers that prevent 4IR technology from being scaled up to address the Global Goals. ""We have a good reason for technology optimism, but we also need a good dose of technology realism,"" said Antonia Gawel, Head of Innovation and Circular Economy, World Economic Forum. ""4IR technologies are tools that still require commitment, policies, and partnerships to put them to work in the service of the Global Goals. With Frontier 2030 and UpLink – our digital platform to engage Gen Z and entrepreneurs in meeting the SDGs – we will make this happen."" The WEF 2020 is scheduled to be organized on 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland.

The report of WEC titled 'Unlocking Technology for the Global Goals' which was released on January 16, 2020, claims that 4IR technology can play a major role in bridging this gap, but new commitments and partnerships will be necessary to move beyond technological optimism.

In their letter, co-facilitators Ngedikes Olai Uludong, Permanent Representative of Palau, and Martin Bille Hermann, Permanent Representative of Denmark, informed Member States that the silence procedure on changes to the theme of the third interactive dialogue was not broken, and they therefore have recommended eight themes to the UN General Assembly President.

The themes are:

addressing marine pollution; managing, protecting, conserving and restoring marine and coastal ecosystems; minimizing and addressing ocean acidification, deoxygenation and ocean warming; making fisheries sustainable and providing access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets; promoting and strengthening sustainable ocean-based economies, in particular for small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs); increasing scientific knowledge and developing research capacity and transfer of marine technology; enhancing the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); and leveraging interlinkages between SDG 14 (life below water) and other Goals towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

The UN Secretary-General will begin preparing concept notes on each of the themes, and will invite Member States and other stakeholders to submit input.

The co-facilitators also informed Member States that by early March 2020 they intend to circulate a zero draft as a starting point for the informal consultations on the intergovernmentally agreed declaration.

The XIV Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Santiago, Chile from 27-31 January 2020, ahead of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), and its Beijing Platform for Action. This year’s CSW session will conduct a review of progress towards the action platform.

The Regional Conference served to review progress towards the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, adopted in 2016 at the XIII Regional Conference, and identify barriers to progress.

Without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.

During the Conference, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) launched a regional progress report that identifies hurdles to achieving gender equality in the region. The Regional Progress Report on the Montevideo Strategy, the first of its kind, recognizes successes towards achieving gender equality in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region to date. It also finds that as LAC governments prepare for Beijing+25, challenges include 1) the sheer magnitude of gender inequalities in the region and the limited State capacities available to address the issue; 2) lack of disaggregated data to analyze the issue; 3) the fact that gender inequalities manifest themselves at international, regional, national and subnational levels, and coordination is needed to renew and implement public policy across governance levels; and 4) the need to increase the budgets allotted to gender equality policies.

The Conference concluded with countries’ approval of the Santiago Commitment. The Commitment’s 48 points outline the means by which countries will accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. It welcomes the Regional Progress Report and reaffirms the commitments made in Beijing in 1995. The Commitment encourages countries to foster and promote public polices on various dimensions of gender equality including education, representation, labor participation, to measure the multiplier effects of boosting the care economy and strengthen the production of gender statistics at the national level, and to voluntarily report on progress.

At the Regional Conference’s closing session, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said it is time to “put an end to patriarchy as a societal model.” Isabel Plá, Chile’s Minister of Women’s Affairs and Gender Equity, emphasized that “without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.” The next session of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean is planned to be held in Argentina, in 2022.

Other regions have also affirmed commitments ahead of Beijing+25. UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab Regions committed to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at meetings organized in November 2019 by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), which resulted in respective declarations on progress.

In Europe, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) held a review meeting from 29-30 October 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland, co-hosted with the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia. In Africa, a regional review took place from 27 October to 1 November 2019, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UN Women and the African Union Commission (AUC).

The Initiative will support land and forest rehabilitation in post conflict areas to reduce peace and security challenges stemming from natural resource degradation.

Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, and Chong-Ho Park, Minister of KFS, Republic of Korea, signed the MoU on 28 January 2020. The goal of the PFI is to “offer countries recovering from violent conflict an opportunity to achieve stability and trust while re-building livelihoods and economies.” Speaking on the Initiative, Thiaw said it “will help address some of the most challenging situations of transboundary management of shared natural resources while promoting peace and cooperation.” Chong-Ho Park said that “the PFI is an effective tool to promote cooperation on the restoration of degraded land and forest in conflict-affected areas.”

The MCO and regional reviews are part of the repositioning process for the UN development system.

Mohammed is providing a series of briefings as well as written updates ahead of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities for Development segment (OAS), which will convene in May 2020.

In the briefing at UN Headquarters on 29 January 2020, Mohammed said the regions have been “the ‘forgotten level,’ largely left untouched in previous reform efforts.” But regional assets are critical to achieve the 2030 Agenda because of the cross-border nature of today’s greatest challenges, including climate, trade, health and conflict, she said.

Mohammed reported on progress that has “significantly raised the bar” for the regional level, including:

Establishing inter-agency teams in each region, with a focus on “unpacking the five broad transformative areas” outlined in the Secretary-General’s 2019 report to ECOSOC;

Detailing the architecture of proposed regional collaboration platforms (RCPs);

Establishing a knowledge hub in each region, with the Arab region’s ‘Manara’ being the most advanced; and

Enhancing transparency at the regional level.

Mohammed said that beginning in 2021, ECOSOC will receive aggregated information on regional collaboration, a type of reporting that “does not currently exist and addresses a major gap in accountability.”

On data and statistics, regional ‘SDG Gateways’ are being established for pooling SDG data for consistent analysis and action. The first SDG Gateways will launch in March 2020 in three regions: Arab States, the Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

In late February 2020, discussions will begin with each region on their specific initiatives. The review will be finalized by late March, she said, and she will discuss work plans and transitions in her visits to each region during its upcoming SDG Forum (Regional Forum for Sustainable Development).

On the MCO review, Mohammed explained that these are offices that cover mostly small islands, which to date have had limited attention to each country’s specificities. After visiting 15 countries in 2019, the Secretariat presented recommendations for improving the UN development system’s support in MCO settings. Subsequently, an inter-agency working group and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) facilitated more specific consultations on putting each proposal into practice.

Mohammed said UN development system entities have made specific commitments including increased financing, data systems, physical presences, technical capacities, and policy advice. In addition, coordination capacities have been provided with greater resources. As a result of this process, seven countries that are serviced by the Caribbean MCO but do not have an office in country will now have a coordination office; and a road map has been created to establish a North Pacific office.

She said OHRLLS continues to hold dialogues with all countries concerned to address remaining questions on substance and process. Resident Coordinators are ensuring that “national counterparts are fully in the loop” and “there will be no implementation before the ECOSOC has the opportunity to consider all proposals” at the OAS session.

The OAS will convene from 19-21 May 2020, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The segment will review four years of implementation of the UNGA guidance contained in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of UN system operational activities for development (QCPR), as well as progress in the repositioning of the UN development system as mandated in UNGA resolution 72/279.

The UNGA will conduct its next QCPR in late 2020. The UN Secretary-General’s report to the ECOSOC operational activities segment is also the main Secretariat input to the UNGA for its QCPR deliberations. ECOSOC’s webpage on the QCPR notes that the 2020 QCPR is “expected to build on the outcomes of the 2019 SDG Summit, thus placing an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.” In addition, it notes that the UNGA will discuss the QCPR “on the heels” of the high-level event commemorating the UN’s 75th anniversary, which could position it to “give new impetus and high-level political guidance to the UN development system repositioning and its efforts to work in an effective and impactful way across peace, development, humanitarian affairs and human rights.” [UN Deputy Secretary-General’s remarks] [ECOSOC website on OAS]","UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed informed UN Member States of steps taken to strengthen the UN development system’s regional level, and its multi-country offices (MCOs) in the Caribbean and Pacific, among other updates.

The declaration was named for the COP’s host city in India.

In addition to the Declaration’s call, a High-Level Segment also contributed outcomes for integration in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected to be adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference, in October, in Kunming, China. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Acting Executive Secretary, informed COP 13 participants that the post-2020 biodiversity framework will be simple and transformative, but unlikely to include targets other than those already in the Aichi Targets.

Towards this end, the High-Level Segment discussed priorities for migratory species conservation in the framework, with speakers highlighting that this was the first CMS COP since the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) sounded the alarm that a million species, including many migratory species, might be lost in the coming decade. Ministers and other high-level participants emphasized the need to mainstream biodiversity across all sectors, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches. They also called for including migratory species considerations in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions on climate change.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices. Seven were added to Appendix I, which comprises migratory species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The seven species added to Appendix I included the Asian elephant, jaguar, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, little bustard, antipodean albatross and the oceanic white-tip shark.

The Urial sheep, smooth hammerhead shark, and the tope shark were listed for protection under Appendix II, which covers migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status and that require international cooperation for their conservation and management. In addition, new and extended Concerted Actions with targeted conservation plans were approved for 14 species.

The Earth Negotiation Bulletin report from COP13 also indicates that Parties also agreed on the following measures benefiting migratory species:

integrate biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy;

strengthen initiatives to combat the illegal killing, taking, and trade of migratory birds;

mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species;

deepen the understanding of the importance of animal culture and social complexity for the conservation of endangered species; and

investigate possible trade in CMS Appendix I species and the implications for their conservation status.

The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

The report also provides evidence for links between WASH and another 14 conditions, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that are not yet quantified.

The report serves as an update and builds on the WHO’s previous analysis of environmental disease burdens and interventions. The agency’s (2016) findings showed that, globally, “1.9 million deaths and 123 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) could have been prevented with adequate WASH. The WASH-attributable disease burden amounted to 3.3% of global deaths and 4.6% of global DALYs.” Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest disease burden from inadequate WASH.

The publication highlights the relationship between improper disposal of excreta, lack of hand washing facilities, and pathogens in drinking water on the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections. It describes how standing and wastewater are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which serve as additional disease vectors.

For the following diseases – diarrhoeal diseases; respiratory infections; soil-transmitted helminthiasis; malaria; trachoma; schistosomiasis; lymphatic filariasis; onchocerciasis; dengue; Japanese encephalitis; protein-energy malnutrition; drowning; arsenicosis ; fluorosis ; legionellosis; leptospirosis; hepatitis A and hepatitis E; methaemoglobinaemia; cyanobacterial toxins; lead poisoning; scabies; spinal injury; poliomyelitis; and adverse neonatal conditions and maternal outcomes – the report gives a detailed account of links to inadequate WASH. Where possible, it also describes interventions and gives economic evaluations.

The report draws particular attention to the impacts of inadequate WASH on young children, noting that, “among children under 5 years, WASH-attributable deaths represent 13% of deaths and 12% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs),” an outcome that could be prevented with existing prevention strategies and interventions. These interventions would include implementation of: water safety planning; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe recreational water environments; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater; and sanitation safety planning to prevent exposure to excreta along the sanitation chain.

Each year starts with the possibility of a new beginning, but often still carries the baggage of the previous year. As 2020 begins, the international community faces deadlines to replace old frameworks and rules with new ones, and to conclude negotiations on new treaties and agreements.

It is timely to take stock of global environmental governance as the world enters a new year and a new decade. In our new report, ‘The State of Global Environmental Governance 2019,’ the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team reflects on the successes, shortcomings and overall trends of 2019. We also look ahead, with optimism 2020 will regain the momentum recently lost.

In 2019, scientists were truth-tellers. Over the course of the year, international scientific bodies produced a range of reports on climate change, biodiversity, and the environment as a whole. Each report contains dire warnings for the future of the planet due to the impact of climate change on food production, of pollution on human health, and land incursions on species extinctions. Given historic inaction, nearly every system on the planet is in danger.

Yet, despite the thousands of pages of scientific evidence, intergovernmental political processes remain deadlocked on so many issues. Policy makers could not mount the type of response commensurate with the science.

Climate change governance had a particularly difficult year, limping to the end of the decade after the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The demands for climate ambition are loud, and angry. Millions of children and youth, feeling their futures have been stolen, participated in climate strikes every Friday throughout the year. Hearing their calls, 67 countries pledged greater climate ambition at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September, but these countries represent only a small fraction of global emissions. As the year came to a close, governments at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP 25) failed to issue a clear call for ambition and could not agree on rules for the market mechanism necessary to complete the Paris Agreement rulebook. The Paris Agreement officially begins in 2020 amid major questions about its ability to catalyze climate ambition and prevent global warming above 2°C.

There were a few bright spots during the year as some policymakers acted on the scientific truths. The first multilateral action to reduce global plastic waste, which amounts to millions of tons each year, was taken under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Certain Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In May, parties to the Basel Convention agreed to include mixed, unrecyclable, and contaminated plastic waste exports into the control regime that requires the consent of importing countries before waste exports can proceed. The fourth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly sent a strong signal that production and consumption of single-use plastics should be reduced or phased out, and the plastics industry has been put on notice. In fact, over the course of the year more than 30 countries around the world, nearly half of which are in Africa, put in place bans on single-use plastic bags.

As we outline in a chapter on linkages, 2019 was also notable for increasing recognition of the need for a more interconnected form of governance. More and more, actors drew linkages among environmental and sustainable development processes, especially biodiversity and climate change, land and climate change, oceans and climate change, human health and the environment, and economics, trade and climate change. The increased understanding about the impacts of degrading ecosystems and a warming climate on local and global economies alike, has led to a number of multinational companies and financial institutions announcing new climate-friendly policies and investments.

Of course, the links among the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are many and complementary. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report was released in time for the SDG Summit in September. The report outlined progress in some critical areas, including declines in extreme poverty and the under-5 mortality rate, increases in access to electricity, and greater efforts to respond to urbanization, waste, and illegal fishing. Nonetheless, many areas need urgent collective attention, including climate change, ocean acidification, land degradation, hunger, education and gender equality. The report also stressed that the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is jeopardized as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts, and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

It is abundantly clear the world needs an urgent, ambitious response to unleash a social and economic transformation. But, in 2019, world leaders appeared detached from the crisis at hand, reading statements that were largely devoid of meaningful pledges. This reaction was in stark contrast to the verdict of the people who rose in protest during the Summit and throughout the year: leaders are failing to address the environmental and development emergency the world faces.

This year, we face a busy international agenda as well as waning political will, rising nationalism, and faltering support for multilateralism. 2020 is expected to conclude negotiations and establish new tools to address biodiversity, marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and a post-2020 strategic approach to international chemicals management. We are already in the fifth year of SDG implementation, and to succeed by their 2030 completion date, governments still need to increase their ambition under the Paris Agreement.

Positive, forward-looking outcomes are essential, but not guaranteed.

In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) informed governments that a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.

Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:

Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

To promote a shift towards circularity, the initiative calls on all tourism companies and destinations to take concrete actions to tackle plastic pollution and increase plastics recycling.

The Global Tourism Plastics initiative aims to reduce plastic pollution from the tourism sector through a set of actionable commitments by 2025. The Initiative will work to eliminate unnecessary or problematic plastic packaging and support the shift from single-use plastic towards reusable alternatives or models by 2025. The Initiative will also engage the value chain to promote 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable and commit to collaborate and invest in increasing the recycling and composting rate for plastics.

The Initiative is an activity of the One Planet Network’s Sustainable Tourism Programme, a multi-stakeholder partnership to implement SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The Initiative acts as the interface between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and the tourism sector. The New Plastics Economy Global Manager, Gerald Naber, said the initiative will unite the tourism sector behind a “vision for a world in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution.” He emphasized that concerted action can help eliminate unneeded plastics and drive innovation to ensure that needed plastics “can be safely and easily circulated—keeping them in the economy and out of the environment.”

UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili welcomed the Initiative as an opportunity for tourism companies and destinations “to step forward and lead the global effort addressing plastic pollution.” He encouraged Initiative participants to set quantifiable targets and help accelerate the tourism sector’s transformation towards more integrated solutions and circular business models.

The Initiative will report annually on progress made towards its targets.

27,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/2030-agenda-testing-multilateralism-states-discuss-un75-declaration/,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,2030 Agenda Testing Multilateralism: States Discuss UN75 Declaration,"UN Member States held their first informal consultations on a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN. The anniversary will be commemorated with a high-level event at UN headquarters in New York, US, on 21 September 2020.

The co-facilitators for the consultations are Anne-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, and Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar. Addressing delegations at the start of the meeting on 21 February 2020, Eneström noted divergent views on some of the topics to be addressed, and said the co-facilitators will “hold the pen” in drafting the resolution, using input from delegations. Al-Thani said the co-facilitators will speak with all interested parties and stakeholders.

This organization has enough documents; it is time to deliver on our commitments.

On the tone and function of the document, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the resolution must resonate with citizens around the world. Eneström said the declaration should: be written in the voice of the heads of state and government that will assemble in September; contain a focused political message; be understandable and inspire action from all stakeholders; speak to youth and others while also being phrased “at a high level,” and give a sense of achievement while inspiring accelerated action.

Governments then offered their views. A few suggested including sections on the UN’s three pillars – development, peace and security, and human rights – as well as references to strengthening, reforming and modernizing the UN. Many said the declaration should reinforce urgency and commitment related to the 2030 Agenda and the Decade of Action. The discussion indicated broad support for reaffirming the principles of multilateralism and the value of a rules-based international system founded on the UN Charter and international law. The “functional nature” of multilateral cooperation should be highlighted, said one government, in order to address the many issues that transcend national borders.

Member States responded to the food-for-thought paper provided by the co-facilitators before the meeting, which suggested that the declaration address five areas: acknowledging achievements; looking ahead; responding to major global challenges; delivering on commitments; and building consensus and mobilizing for change.

On acknowledging achievements, one delegation said the paradigm of the UN has been changed to put the 2030 Agenda at the heart of its work. Governments also highlighted that the UN has: contributed to a strong body of international law, which should be universalized; provided a common covenant on preserving the rights of future generations; prevented further world wars; improved living standards; and achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

On looking ahead, delegations called for genuine reflection on strengthening global governance and multilateralism, for aligning the UN’s intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and for transforming the UN’s values into people’s lived experiences. One government said a better balance must be reached between the peace and security dimension and the development dimension of the UN’s work, noting that all available energy and resources seem to be activated for peace and security issues, but when it comes to development, “everything is just voluntary.”

Some delegations highlighted the importance of the sovereign equality of states, with one saying that “in reality, not all States are created equal, but large or small, all have an equal right to be heard here at the UN, and all have rights and obligations.” Others emphasized the communications role of the UN, noting the need for “a UN that listens to people and can communicate more clearly.” One highlighted the SDGs as a communications asset.

On responding to global challenges, some echoed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ assessment of challenges and threats set out in January 2020. He had identified as “four horsemen” that endanger progress: geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology. Building on these ideas, governments said the world needs a stronger UN than ever before, and highlighted: non-traditional security threats; inequalities within countries; artificial intelligence; xenophobia, hate speech, and migrant rights violations; climate change and pollution, the importance of a successful UNFCCC COP 26 to address the “increasingly existential” threat of the climate and environment crisis, and the need for the UN to mobilize means to address both mitigation and adaptation;

On ways for the UN to better deliver on its purposes and principles, one delegate said that “turning 75 usually means retirement,” but for the UN it must be a time of rejuvenation and reform. Speakers stressed that the UN must modernize in order to not lose confidence of people, and it must adapt to the challenges of the 21st century to remain the primary forum for multilateral cooperation.

Governments highlighted the need for reforms to the UNGA, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN’s peacebuilding architecture. They emphasized in particular the need for the Security Council to become more representative, but also for reforms to limit the use of the veto, such as in situations of mass atrocities.

Delivering on specific commitments and frameworks from the UN was also a priority for many speakers, with one saying that “this organization has enough documents”; the most important priority now is to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlighted the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.”

On building consensus and mobilizing for change, the co-facilitators had asked for input on how the Decade of Action can advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind, as well as how the UN can maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors, and how it can strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth? Many highlighted the importance of engaging women, girls and all youth, with one noting that events in 2020 make it a particularly important year for women and girls. One delegation said developing countries need funding, especially from the private sector, to pursue the Decade of Action and empower women and youth. Another said “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She called for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

On the challenges of reaching agreement on the declaration, delegates suggested that the process “focus on what unites us and avoid what divides us,” noting that this declaration cannot resolve all unfinished business from the last 75 years. Instead it should highlight areas of convergence, so the declaration and the anniversary commemoration can unite rather than polarize the membership.

Going forward, the co-facilitators will prepare an elements paper for the declaration. They plan to convene a meeting to discuss the elements in early April 2020. They said the UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary, Fabrizio Hochschild, will be invited to that meeting to provide updates on preparations for the anniversary and the related global consultation process.

The commemoration event will take place on 21 September 2020, at UN headquarters in New York, US. [IISD Sources]","UN Member States held their first informal consultations on a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN.

28,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/irp-report-proposes-governance-framework-for-extractives/,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IRP Report Proposes Governance Framework for Extractives,"The UN Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel (IRP) has called for the development of a ‘Sustainable Development License to Operate’ (SDLO), in its report on the governance of extractive industries. Governments have increased efforts to decouple their economies from resource use, but the demand for extractive resources is projected to continue to grow, especially in emerging economies.

As a basis for the proposed SDLO framework, the report titled, ‘Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing Extractive Industries Towards Sustainable Development,’ maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives that focus on delivering the SDGs. The authors lament, however, that the existing frameworks do not operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

Noting that extractive industries can cause extensive and lasting damage, the report critiques the current paradigm of “social license to operate” (SLO), which it notes arose as a response to business risk. The SLO paradigm aims to accommodate community demands to the minimum extent necessary to avoid public opposition and social conflict, and associated reputational damage, the authors write.

To move beyond SLO and consolidate existing instruments, the report sets out consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the SDGs and other international policy commitments. It identifies eight SDGs in which the extractive sector, if well-managed, can play a positive role: Goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Effective mineral resource governance incorporates human rights, responsible business practices, greater engagement of home countries, and economic decoupling.

UNEP emphasizes that the minerals and metals industry can promote social cohesion, inclusiveness and economic progress among low-income countries and vulnerable populations, but guidance is needed. The report elaborates that the SDLO model advocates for fairer deals, equal share of benefits among stakeholders and holistic consideration of regulations that are not inclusive on their own.

The proposed SDLO framework addresses large-scale mining and investigates artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), in which some marginalized groups in certain geographies partake, though often without oversight by policymakers. The framework does so in part by extending responsibility to ensure implementation is shared by both “host” and “home” countries, and by expanding the scope to a broader swath of the extractive value chain. However, the authors caution that the SDLO is not a substitute for laws and regulations, and that extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water.

Prerequisites of an effective mineral resource governance framework, the report notes, include decoupling economic growth from environmental and social impacts, protecting human rights, establishing responsible business practices, and ensuring greater engagement of home countries. With respect to national and sub-national governance, the report recommends that countries establish three public institutions: an environment directorate, a mining directorate and a geological survey to regulate the mines and metals industries. The report also articulates the role and responsibility of host governments, which includes devising responsible concession agreements, mainstreaming environmental assessment, domesticating natural capital accounting, ensuring transparency and channeling extractive rents into public investment.

Internationally, the report advocates for the creation of an International Minerals Agency to improve coordination mechanisms, or at least settling on an international agreement to share data on economic geology, mineral demand and the industry’s impacts. It suggests that this agreement could be negotiated through existing for a such as the UN Environment Assembly, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, and wider ongoing UN processes focused on reviewing progress towards the SDGs.

As the clock ticks towards 2030, the year when the world’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/en/ must be achieved, countries are working to improve their systems of statistic-gathering and analyses for better planning in crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry sectors.

However, the capacity to adequately monitor and analyse agricultural statistics varies dramatically country-by-country, and no where in the world is that variance more prevalant than in the Asia-Pacific region.

Pietro Gennari, Chief Statistician of FAO, noted the significant data gaps in Asia-Pacific in monitoring the SDGs, and the slow progress towards achieving its goals. “Slow country commitment to measuring the SDGs, and the poor performance towards achieving the SDGs, are closely connected. We are witnessing an inversion of the familiar axiom whereby “what gets measured gets done”. We are not measuring the SDG indicators, and this is one of the crucial reasons why we are not on track to achieving the SDG targets.”

Special Commission convenes in Bali to address the gaps

FAO today opened the 28th Session of the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS)http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-events/ess-apcas, in Bali, Indonesia. The Commission Session runs from 10-14 February. It is hosted by the Government of Indonesia with more than 100 participants from some 30 countries and 10 international and regional organizations attending.

Focusing on the specific needs of food and agricultural statistics of Asia-Pacific, this biennial meeting of agricultural statisticians and experts reviews and support the region’s preparedness to produce adequate statistics to monitor progress towards the 2030 SDG targets.

What doesn’t get measured doesn’t get done: The urgency for statistics in the progress to end hunger

Food insecurity plays an important role as a determinant of many different forms of hunger and malnutrition. The majority of the world’s hungry, and children affected by stunting, live in Asia. Hunger has increased in many countries where the economy has slowed down or contracted, mostly in middle-income countries. Furthermore, economic shocks are contributing to prolonging and worsening the severity of food crises caused primarily by conflict and climate shocks. Even in upper-middle and high-income countries malnutrition is an issue, with obesity evident in school-age children, adolescents, and adults.

“Collaboration among internal institutions within the government such as Statistics Indonesia, Ministry of Agriculture, relevant ministries/agencies with the FAO of the United Nations, is needed to produce high quality agricultural statistics that are accurate, timely and relevant to provide SDG’s indicators. said Chief Statistician of Statistics Indonesia, Dr. Suhariyanto, in his key note speech. “Sharing of knowledge and good practices in the regional conference, such as APCAS, is a way to improve and accelerate production of agricultural statistics in Asia Pacific. Adding to that, the discussion at the forum will be effective to monitor the SDGs achievements in the region.”

“Agenda 2030 identifies 17 goals, 169 targets and some 232 indicators to monitor progress. This is a huge and daunting task for national statisticians, and the clock is ticking down to 2030. With only a decade to go, and nearly half a billion hungry people still struggling to survive in our region, we must strengthen partnerships among governments, international organizations and the private sector to meet these data needs,” said Stephen Rudgard, FAO Representative to Indonesia. “FAO stands ready to support national efforts through its technical assistance programmes.”

The APCAS meeting provides a platform for Asia Pacific countries to directly engage in drawing attention to their unique challenges in development of agricultural statistics such as geographical remoteness, changing cropping patterns and livestock rearing due to climate change and transboundary diseases, and limited statistical infrastructure and resources.

A plan for improving the use of ICT and “Big Data” in Agriculture Statistics

Adding to the many firsts, FAO announced new partnerships to help countries adopt cost effective technologies to produce agriculture statistics. FAO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a massive open on-line courses in 2019 and handbooks will be launched during APCAS on use of tablet-based data collection using Computer Assisted Personal Interviews. Hundreds of thousands to millions of paper questionnaires can now be replaced with less than a few thousand tablet computers in the largest of countries, saving time, money, transportation and trees. FAO also announced a partnership with the ADB and the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to help countries use satellite data to generate agriculture statistics. FAO, ADB and AIT will host a three-data expert meeting on this subject after APCAS, joined by various regional experts and private sector firms.

“This new data source is part of what we call Big Data, and its development is often led by the private sector. Partnering with the private sector allows us to innovate, and is a game changer in how governments produce official statistics. We will discuss this during APCAS, and in more detail in the three-day expert group meeting that follows. Several private firms will join the expert group meeting to explore how we can work better together to enable official statistics to exploit these new non-traditional, powerful and real-time data sources,” said Sangita Dubey, FAO Regional Statistician and Secretary of the Commission.

The APCAS session will also review other new approaches to developing and integrated system of Agricultural Census and Surveys, enhance data quality assurance, produce and share privacy-protected micro data, and provide crop, livestock and fisheries statistics in a cost-effective manner.

The recommendations of APCAS will serve as a guide and lay down priorities for FAO for the next two years in its effort towards building capacity of countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Companies often highlight in their Sustainability Reports the positive contributions they make to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, while generally omitting any mention of negative impacts that would impede achievement of the SDGs. This one-sided reporting fails to present stakeholders with a true picture of the challenges the mining sector faces in its support of the SDGs, according to the RMI Report 2020, which was released today by the Responsible Mining Foundation (RMF).

Hélène Piaget, CEO of the RMF said: ""The SDGs provide a valuable societal framework for reporting and action on economic, social and environmental concerns, but an unbalanced emphasis on the 'good' that companies do may obscure the negative impacts, be they inherent or unintentional, that may impede the achievement of the SDG goals.''

The RMI Report 2020 is an evidence-based assessment of the economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) policies and practices of 38 large-scale mining companies that operate in more than 780 mine sites and together account for 28 percent of the world's mining activity by value of production. In addition, the Report assesses 180 individual mine sites in 45 countries against 10 basic indicators of responsible mining. The one-year study consists of a deep-dive into each company, with approximately two months spent reviewing and assessing each company.

The RMI Report 2020 shows a modest overall improvement on many issues by most of the companies previously assessed in the RMI Report 2018. However, much of the improvement is due to companies making commitments, with markedly less evidence of progress in following-up these commitments with concrete actions. And the weakest results relate to companies' efforts to track, review and act to improve the effectiveness of their actions on EESG issues. So while commitments are a step in the right direction, the mining sector as a whole would benefit – both in terms of its performance and its trust-building with other stakeholders – from being able to demonstrate more consistent implementation of commitments across operational portfolios and across issues.

According to the International Labor Organization, mining remains one of the top three most hazardous sectors. During the two years since the last RMI assessment, several large-scale mining companies have been at the centre of major controversies as mine tailings failures have claimed scores of lives, devastated whole communities and caused major environmental disasters. Afshin Mehrpouya, Associate Professor at HEC Paris and member of the Board of the RMF said: ""Such tragedies reflect very poorly on the sector as a whole and put into stark perspective companies' claims of responsible mining. The industry must redouble its efforts to prove that it prioritises broader ESG responsibilities over short-term considerations.""

The RMI Report 2020 highlights a disconnect between company-wide policies and standards versus on-the-ground actions at mine sites, where the impacts of mining are most evident. Companies often show little or no evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighbouring communities, workers, governments and investors. Likewise, there is scant evidence of companies engaging with local stakeholders on these issues, which include for example local procurement, grievance mechanisms or air and water quality. Of the 180 individual mine sites assessed, only one site scores more than 50 percent, while 145 sites score less than 20 percent and 45 sites score zero on all 10 indicators. None of the companies shows consistent performance across the mine sites they own or operate.

As with the 2018 assessment, the RMI Report 2020 shows that it can be done: mining can meet society's expectations. If one company were to achieve all the highest scores recorded in each of the 71 indicators, it would reach more than 70 percent of the maximum achievable score. Similarly, if one mine site were to achieve all the highest scores seen for the asset-level indicators, it would score over 80 percent. All companies are encouraged to adopt more systematically the good practices already being demonstrated across the sector.

The RMI Report 2020 shows that requirements set by home or producing countries or by investors drive stronger company action and transparency on EESG issues. For example, investor-led demands for disclosure of the location and safety of mine tailings storage facilities have prompted more complete and more publicly available data of critical interest to share- and bondholders, insurers and governments.

""While the trust-deficit with society is recognised as the number one risk for mining companies, the RMI Report 2020 acts as a prompt to the industry to eliminate the need to respond to multiple information requests. By proactively making EESG data available – starting at individual mine sites and in open data formats companies can help to build trust, limit risk, and show respect. In fact, more proactive data disclosure will reduce the demand for companies' reporting,"" said Hélène Piaget.

As part of its commitment to sharing leading practice and learning, open data principles and transparency, the RMI Report 2020 is available online in seven languages and contains detailed results covering more than 6,000 data points. In addition, 69 leading practices, the scoring framework, 3,800 source documents collected from the public domain or submitted by companies during the review period, together with contextual data for each company (including searchable tables of 3,500+ shareholders, 3,000+ subsidiaries, 1,000+ mine sites, 1,200+ tailings storage facilities, and fatality reporting) are all available online.

Editor's Notes

THE RESPONSIBLE MINING FOUNDATION

The Responsible Mining Index (RMI) assessment and summary report are produced by the Responsible Mining Foundation (RMF), an independent research organisation that encourages continuous improvement in responsible mining across the industry by developing tools and frameworks, sharing public-interest data and enabling informed and constructive engagement between mining companies and other stakeholders.

The Foundation supports the principle that minerals and metals mining should benefit the economies, improve the lives of peoples and respect the environments of producing countries, while allowing companies and their investors to make a fair and viable return.

The Foundation's work and research reflect what society at large can reasonably expect from mining companies on economic, environmental, social and governance matters. The RMF does not accept funding from the mining industry and receives the majority of its funding from the governments of Switzerland and The Netherlands and from the Triodos Foundation.

In December 2019 and January 2020, we saw this in discussions and reports on adaptation finance. They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows. Discussions also focused on the need for current business models to adapt to increasing climate risks and transform production processes to halt nature loss.

Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about the level of progress made. On the one hand, they saw missed opportunities such as to determine how cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement on climate change should advance. On the other, they noted steady achievements in the work of scientific bodies. In January, lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II (WG II) continued to advance work on the Group’s contribution to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6), focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, due for release in October 2021.

Seen in the light of adaptation funding activities, identified impacts and needs, these recent discussions suggest that climate change adaptation requires a rethinking of production, redistribution and equity. This Policy Brief focuses on these and other recent developments that inform climate adaptation finance.

UNFCCC Reflects on Its Integration of Adaptation, Prepares for 2023 Global Stocktake

The Adaptation Committee, established in 2010 under the UNFCCC, issued a report reflecting on the evolution of adaptation in the climate regime and outlining its work towards the first global stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement scheduled in 2023. Titled, ‘25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC,’ the report was released at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December 2019. Citing findings from the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report draws attention to increasingly more urgent adaptation needs.

The report notes that rising adaptation costs are likely to range from USD 140 billion to 300 billion per annum by 2030, and could rise to between USD 280 billion and 500 billion per annum by 2050. The Committee highlights the specific roles of the Convention’s Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism to support adaptation. Reporting on its own activities, the Committee informs of its partnerships with international, regional and national stakeholders and its efforts on engaging the private sector. A strategy for private sector engagement was also discussed at the 57th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council in December.

Looking forward, the Adaptation Committee notes that the seventh review of the GEF, the oldest operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, will be initiated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC will also start key negotiations on the post-2025 finance goal. Over the course of 2020, developed countries are expected to make submissions on finance beyond 2020 and on the alignment of global finance with the Paris goals.

The Committee further outlines its work towards the 2023 global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assessment of collective progress towards achieving its long-term goals. The global stocktake will conduct a review of overall progress made towards achieving the global goal on adaptation and the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation action and support. Inputs for the stocktake will include reports from the “network of institutions” established to enhance adaptation actions.

COP 25 Agrees of Arrangements for Adaptation Fund Going Forward, But Further Work Remains

The Adaption Fund approved a record USD 188 million in new projects in 2019, and reached the milestone of 100 concrete adaptation projects financed in vulnerable developing countries. The Fund fosters country ownership and enables direct access to adaptation finance for applicants from accredited national implementing entities from developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. It provides new learning opportunities, such as e-learning programmes to enhance access to climate finance, and new grants that foster adaptation practices on the ground and scale up effective projects.

Given its important role and the benefits it creates for an increasing number of countries in need of adaptation finance, the Fund welcomed two decisions taken during the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December, on decreasing risks of interruptions in the Fund’s work. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted:

amendments to the Fund’s arrangements with the World Bank to provide services as its interim trustee, to now be an open-ended arrangement; and

a decision that there will be no end date attached to its memorandum of understanding with the GEF Council on the GEF hosting the Fund’s secretariat.

However, the fact that COP 25 failed to conclude negotiations on the modalities of cooperative approaches under Paris Agreement Article 6 left some open questions.

In line with previous decisions, the Fund has served the Paris Agreement since January 2019. It will no longer serve the Kyoto Protocol once the share of proceeds becomes available under the sustainable development mechanism of Agreement Article 6.4, though it will continue to receive the share of proceeds, if available, from activities under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

The failure to conclude negotiations at COP 25 leaves unclear precisely how much of the share of proceeds under Agreement Article 6.4 sustainable development mechanism will become available for the Adaptation Fund. There seems to be consensus on a minimum share of 2% but possible increases are still under discussion. Parties further disagreed, among others, on whether a share of proceeds would also come from both market-based approaches, namely transactions under the mechanism, as well as from the trading of Article 6.2 “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs). Many countries called for equal treatment of rules for both approaches, for a number of reasons. In the context of adaptation finance, developing countries highlighted the value of predictable funding. As reported by some analysts, many of the countries likely to be on the buying end, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Norway, are concerned about higher costs of their carbon offsets.

COP 25 also did not result in any decision on whether the membership representation of developing and developed countries on the Adaptation Fund Board should change, given its role in serving the Paris Agreement.

Tracking Adaptation Finance

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has set out to tackle significant data and reporting challenges to capturing global adaptation finance flows. Adaptation investment, the Initiative finds, is difficult to track due to challenges associated with context dependency, the uncertain causality of investments made, a lack of impact metrics, and confidentiality and reporting requirements.

For this reason, CPI’s report titled, ‘ Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019,’ does not track any private sector adaptation finance. The Initiative underlines that almost all adaptation finance covered in the report was funded by public actors and that the tracking of public domestic adaptation finance remains limited. Nevertheless, that report finds that adaptation finance gained momentum in 2017-2018, increasing 35% to an annual average of USD 30 billion from 2015-2016, although adaptation still accounts for just 5% of tracked climate finance based on available data.

In its subsequent December report titled, ‘Tracking Adaptation Finance: Advancing Methods to Capture Finance Flows in the Landscape,’ CPI briefs on potential methods to fill data gaps for the tracking of adaptation finance flows, and proposes methods to measure progress.

The proposed framework, the authors suggest, can serve to identify information that should be tracked and reported by local governments and companies. The aim is to improve the understanding, and, ultimately, delivery, of adaptation finance. CPI finds that:

Investment flows that are specific to adaptation and resilience must be understood in the context of the total investment that receives a resilience benefit from the incremental adaptation investment;

Adaptation- and resilience-focused flows should be measured against total investment by sector to understand progress made to achieve resilience against a benchmark; and

Technical approaches, such as keyword searches and investment matching against national adaptation goals and geographic climate risk, can help identify adaptation flows in datasets that do not label them as such.

World Economic Forum Recognizes Climate and “Nature-based” Risks

The World Economic Forum (WEF), which convened for its 50th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from 21-24 January 2020, issued its annual Global Risks Report 2020. Based on its Global Risks Perception Survey results, the Forum concurs with findings from other fora that climate change is the stand-out long-term risk the world faces. It stresses that the near-term consequences of climate change amount to a “planetary emergency” with catastrophic, wide-ranging and intersecting implications. The WEF report also ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years.

As a traditionally business-centric gathering, the WEF finds that USD 44 trillion of economic value generation is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Illustrating how nature loss impacts businesses’ operations, supply chains and markets, the Forum urges the business community to adapt to several nature-based risks and implications. These risks, explained in another WEF report titled, ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ can be assessed using climate risk categories as defined in the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Under its ‘Nature Action Agenda’ stakeholder platform, the Forum has identified areas where strategic transformation of current business models and production processes can contribute the most to halting and reversing nature loss, and ways to finance this transformation.

Climate Change Adaptation Requires Rethinking of Production, Redistribution and Equity

Reflecting on these discussions, one cannot ignore the diversity of stakeholder groups engaged in addressing climate change impacts and their growing need of global adaptation finance. That need is estimated at USD 180 billion annually from 2020-2030 and USD 50 billion annually from many developing countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. While the UNFCCC and its constituent bodies prepare for upcoming procedural tasks, and the IPCC is advancing work towards AR6 publication, others talk about business opportunities and revenues. Few can envision the estimated sums in question. Half of the world’s biggest companies say “climate adaptation solutions could result in USD 236 billion in increased revenue.” Some suggest that “in the food and land-use sector alone, the climate challenge provides an annual business opportunity of USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2030.” At the same time, those that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including African farmers and island nations, speak of securing their livelihoods and coping with the negative impacts of climate change while lacking the means to adapt.

One of the notions underpinning these contrasting discussions is equity, with its different meanings and undertones. In an effort to to answer the basic economic questions of production and distribution, which all societies grapple with, we could think of what products are going to be made and by what means. How are the claims on production and incomes divided among resource contributors? How is production divided between private and public purposes? And more pertinently perhaps, given the limited ecological capacity within which the established global economy has to function, how is production divided between the present and the future?","They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to alleviate social, economic, and environmental problems by the year 2030, but progress has been slower than necessary and scattershot in impact. Certain SDGs tend to attract awareness and action from companies if they are closely related to their business objectives, but others (#1 No Poverty, for example, or #14 Life Below Water) seem relegated to specialist intervention. The goals themselves are nonbinding, absent government adoption and mandates, and there are only a handful of standards for the management and/or reporting of SDG performance.

Most of the world’s stock exchanges support the SDGs. Industry advocacy and support takes many forms, including participation in the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative and the UN Global Compact. Some exchanges have also integrated the work of the SDGs into the sustainability tools and support that they provide to listed companies, leveraging events, white papers, and webinars to demonstrate the market value and business impact of the SDGs.

“Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation.”

Yet a relatively small number of companies are publicly reporting progress against the SDGs, which implies that the 2030 target is in serious jeopardy. Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), fundamental building blocks of job creation and international development, seem to be particularly silent. The most recent Sustainable Development Goals Report (UN, 2018) cites certain factors for this, including a lack of expertise and resources, especially in developing economies.

Given this seeming gap between advocacy and performance, we wanted to examine the level of SDG awareness, action, and efficacy within the global exchange community. WFE provided CFI.co an understanding of SDGs-related industry practices based on a WFE survey.

Under Chief Executive Nandini Sukumar, the WFE created a set of Sustainability Principles that (among other things) formalizes industry commitment to the UN SDGs by accelerating development of sustainable finance and promoting awareness in the capital market. Ms. Sukumar, citing the WFE Annual Sustainability Survey, says, “73% of the exchanges with sustainability initiatives have some form of SDG-specific initiatives. These initiatives include education programs on SDGs for issuers, disclosure guidance and offering SDG-related products in their markets.” Certain SDGs (#5 Gender Equality, #8 Decent Work Conditions, and #13 Climate Action) are the most engaged among WFE members.

Survey Results

We sent questions to the Sustainability Working Group — a subset of WFE members that are especially committed to sustainable business integration — and received responses for more than half of them. Participating exchanges included B3 (Brazil), Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, Borsa Istanbul, Bourse de Casablanca, Dubai Financial Market, the Egyptian Exchange, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange Group, National Stock Exchange of India, Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Two members elected to remain anonymous, and Nasdaq itself has contributed to the industry data in this article.

We found that awareness and valuation of the SDGs is nearly universal, yet actionable progress is not being measured. The SDGs are vital to capital market function, particularly for listed firms and their respective supply chains. Without reaching for the Goals, one responding exchange said, “Neither the capital markets nor the real economy will be able to survive in the coming decades.”

80% claim that the SDGs are well understood in their market

87% believe that the SDGs are a fundamental part of the sustainable economy

More exchanges (54%) do not measure SDG progress than do (46%)

Wanting to press further, we asked this question: How does your exchange engage, inform, or otherwise communicate with issuers and other stakeholders about the UN SDGs? The disparate range of answers may help to explain the gap between industry awareness and industry action, as there is no global standard for measurement – but it’s also clear that the responding exchanges are proactive.

“The SDGs are recommended as a global reporting framework for listed companies in LSEG ESG reporting guidance,” according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). “FTSE Russell — the global, multi-asset index provider part of LSEG — develops investment tools that incorporate alignment with the SDGs in the index design.”

Taiwan Stock Exchange cited strong information disclosure, corporate governance, stewardship responsibility, sustainable product development, and market capacity building as evidence of their commitment to SDG progress. Other exchanges cited index development as a key driver. Other exchanges were more candid about market inhibitors. Further support from stakeholders including issuers is needed to allow exchanges to move forward more aggressively.

Other Industry Initiatives

The UN and exchange leaders had previously identified the SDGs that most pertain to the industry and the various ways that capital markets can help deliver on the Goals. Per this guidance, the SDGs that receive special emphasis from Nasdaq and others include:

#5 Gender Equality. Ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.

#12 Responsible Consumption and Production. Encouraging companies, especially large and trans-national companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.

#13 Climate Action. Improving education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

#17 Partnerships for the Goals. Enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of sustainable development goals in all countries, particularly developing countries.

An influential joint report from the UN SSE and the WFE (How Exchanges Can Embed Sustainability Within their Operations: A Blueprint to Advance Action, 2019) makes one point clear: “The imperative of sustainability as embodied in the SDGs demands deep transformative change from both business and public policy. For exchanges, the incorporation of sustainability considerations is likely to be a determinant of long-term performance and resilience in a changing world.”

The fund is accepting contributions from a range of partners to meet its $50 million target size, with the Nordic Development Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and the Government of Australia providing capital for the project’s preparation.



Operations are expected to begin in Q2 2020 with investment in early stage startups focused on addressing ESG issues such as climate change and the empowerment of women. ADB Ventures has a 17-year fund life, which means it can invest long-term capital into the projects selected.



Mike Barrow, director general for private sector operations, ADB, says: “This region is brimming with technology solutions to conserve energy, reduce waste, fight climate change, and deliver public services effectively.



“Our vision is for ADB Ventures to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to achieve the SDGs by 2030.”

Impact technology solutions refer to specially designed technologies which are fundamentally aimed at making a positive impact toward ESG factors.

Barrow continues: “ADB Ventures will help bring these solutions to market by leveraging our extensive operational networks and filling the risk capital gap facing innovative early-stage companies in developing Asia and the Pacific, particularly smaller and frontier markets.”

ADB differentiates itself from a typical VC fund by going beyond the sourcing and provision of capital. ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 (the facility’s anchor trust fund) is augmented by a $12 million technical assistance program that will be deployed to the startups over three years. The program is two-pronged, with the ADB Ventures SEED grant program promoting expansion into emerging markets and the validation and de-risking of technology pilots.

The second leg of the assistance program, ADB Venture Lab provides a suite of innovation programs and will generate technology pilot opportunities to the anchor fund’s portfolio companies.



The announcement echoes a recent wave of banks and other large institutions making significant pledges to allocate resources toward sustainable ventures and re-align their portfolios to meet self-imposed carbon neutral commitments.



Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BlackRock and JP Morgan are just a handful of industry leaders working toward these goals, some of which are also deploying impact investing funds to support environmentally focused fintechs.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), has established the ADB Ventures platform to feed investment and support to Asian startups which are developing solutions aimed at achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“Perpetrators of the deadly suicide bombing in Lethpora in south Kashmir district of Pulwama last year during which about 40 CRPF jawan were killed have been eliminated and the case taken to its logical conclusion” Zulfikar Hassan said .

He said that after the Pulwama blast, large-scale operations were conducted against the militants and their organizations operating in Kashmir valley during which number of militants including their top brass were eliminated which broke the back of them and they were pushed to the backfoot, the Special Director General of CRPF told reporters on the sidelines of an event held on Friday at the 185th Battalion CRPF camp located in Lethpora in South Kashmir. The event was organized to pay tributes to the CRPF personnel killed in the Pulwama attack.

Apart from the Special DG, various senior CRPF officers and jawans also attended the event.

Pakistan based militant organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has taken the responsibility of the deadly suicide attack when a car rammed with a CRPF vehicle leaving about 40 personnel dead on February 14, 2020.

Responding to reporters questions after paying tribute to the CRPF personnel, Zulfiqar Hassan said: ""I do not want to talk about justice, but the fact is that within a few months after the Pulwama attack the key culprits were killed.

He said several people were also arrested who assisted outside attackers as OGWs. Those who carried out the attack have been handed over to the disbelievers. '

CRPF Special DG said after the Pulwama attack militant outfits have been pushed to the wall and their back was broken with the swift action of the forces. He hoped that the coming months would be peaceful in the Kashmir valley.

He further said that the CRPF is with the families of martyrs and added that they stand by with the jawans of the force.

It was the largest suicide attack of its kind in the Valley during the armed uprising that began in the 1990s. At least 40 CRPF personnel were killed and nearly a dozen others were injured in a deadly suicide IED blast on February 14 last year in Lethapura Pulwama.

The devastating suicide bombing by militants was carried out by a car. Pakistani militant outfit Jaish Mohammad claimed responsibility for the attack.","All militants involved in the suicide attack in which more than fourty CRPF jawans were killed have been eliminated said the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Special Director General Jammu and Kashmir Zulfikar Hassan today.

36,https://taarifa.rw/beyond-policy-and-public-investment-the-sdg-imperative-for-business/,"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Taarifa Rwanda,Beyond policy And Public Investment: The SDG Imperative For Business,"The immediate implication of a chasm which public information management in Nigeria has successfully created between the government and the people is that the country now has two major debating groups.

The first group is made up of those who adversely criticize whatever President Muhammadu Buhari does or fails to do, while the second group consists of those who see no wrong whatsoever in the activities of Buhari’s government.

The two groups have something in common which is that most Nigerians do not understand either of them.

Perhaps because both groups are unaware of this situation, they have continued to seize every opportunity to eloquently disagree with one another on every subject so as to convince us that they have good points either way.

So, when Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki last week painted a frightening picture but which looks like a true story of the precarious Nigerian economy, the resultant huge war of words between the pro and anti-Buhari crusaders especially the non-state actors could not have surprised any analyst who has followed street debates in the country.

As if to sensitize people on the state of the nation’s economy, Obaseki had raised an alarm that our finances have gone so low that last month,government had to print more money for states to share to meet their obligations.

This was unacceptable to some people who decided to react to the allegation. First, was an unsigned statement that government was unaware of any printing of money as alleged. One comedian immediately tweeted that “the man didn’t say you were aware, he said you printed.

”The second reaction described the governor’s alarm as a lie while the third educated us on the correct terminology for what happened – lending, not printing. Painfully, what should be of concern to us has been buried by the controversy.

The fact that what was shared was a form of loan seems to establish that there was not enough to share. Whether the extra that was borrowed was printed or conjured by a magician cannot controvert the fact that Nigeria is hugely broke.

If such truth must be told to put our status in correct perspective, then Obaseki’s alarm can hardly be wished away especially if his entire statement and not just theexcerpt on printing is read in full.

Indeed, there are vital parts of the statement that have been ignored. For the benefit of those who may not have read Obaseki’s statement, here is a crucial aspect that ought not to be downplayedor discountenanced.

According to the governor, “everywhere else, governments rely on the people to produce taxes and that is what they use to run the local government, state and the federation.

But with the way we run Nigeria, the country can go to sleep. At the end of the month, we just go to Abuja, collect money and we come back to spend.

We are in trouble, huge financial trouble. The current price of crude oil is only a mirage. The major oil companies who are the ones producing are no longer investing much in oil.

Shell is pulling out of Nigeria and Chevron is now one of the world’s largest investors in alternative fuel, so in another year or so, where will we find this money that we go to share in Abuja?”

This quotation is no doubt a veritable wake-up call for us all to rise to the occasion and change our spending habit.

This is more so when the governor also clearly stated that it would be unfair for Nigerians to expect one man – Buhari, to be left alone to face the enormous problems.

In other words, the governor’s statement created no room for claims and counter claims amongst politicians or supporters.

It is also important to make the point that this is not the first time some of us are getting confused about the internal sources of Nigeria’s colossal loans.

Last month, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) announced that his corporation could no longer bear the huge subsidy payments of over N120 billion monthly subsidy for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).

The NNPC according to Kyari has been absorbing the cost differential between the actual and selling cost of the product by recording it in its financial books.

Not many understood the statement. From which of its books does NNPC get such huge sums every month?

If NNPC had been paying all its funds into the Federation Account as legally expected what magic does the Corporation employ to accommodate massive subsidy payments; is it by merely writing the amounts in its books?

Indeed, during the peak of the Covid 19 pandemic, there were certain expenses which Nigeria was too broke to accommodate and which both the NNPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), graciously accepted to co-settle.

Do these two bodies have their own supply of funds? Answers to a question such as this may illuminate the state of Nigeria’s finances Is Nigeria really in financial trouble, if so, to what extent?

The latest answer to this question was given a few days ago by Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed who said “the nation’s debt profile was still within sustainable limit.”

The statement was quite comforting on its face value but the situation on ground appears to counter it because if we still have capacity to borrow more, why not go ahead and resolve the numerous issues waiting to be settled?

From basic economics we can imagine that our current inflation rate reflects a decline in the purchasing power of our naira which is itself not available to many. Only last week, the National Bureau of Statistics released her consumer price index (CPI) for March 2021.

In the report,inflation was said to have risen to 18% in March representing 0.82% when compared to 17% recorded in February.

Similarly, food inflation rose by 5.0% to 23% in March from 22 percent in February. The report is worth worrying about especially as the scarce funds available are swallowed by personnel costs across the nation. How do we develop?

The body language of the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele at the press conference where he was requested to react to Obaseki’s comment, showed he was visibly upset that his sacrifices do not appear appreciated.

Of course no responsible CBN can watch her nation in trouble without intervening. Again, no one doubts that our CBN has never been this stressed in history.

Governor Emefiele must take solace in the fact that he has been able to withstand the vagaries of the economic weather of Nigeria in the last couple of troublesome years.

To say that Nigeria is super broke is not an indictment but telling the truth about our situation for general enlightenment.

One of the advantages of educating people on the true status of our economy is that it can have an effect on the increasing demands by different striking Nigerian workers on all kinds of expectations.

What displeases Nigerians is not the disclosure of the true state of their nation’s economy but the transparent inequity where at this critical stage, some people still enjoy wardrobe, newspaper or other forms of annoying comfort while others are dying.

I’ve been there, it’s quarantined off.” Roumeliotis pointed to the fact the quarantined area is currently manned by Canadian Red Cross workers, Army personnel, public health agency workers and an emergency management medical assistance team. “If I was infected and coughed, it would go a couple of feet but drop to the ground and stay there,” he said. “If someone happened to touch it, they might get infected— but it’s not going to be airborne and going into ventilation like other viruses do.”

Article content The Eastern Ontario Health Unit is providing regular status updates on the quarantine at the Cornwall NAV CENTRE. Our... Posted by Eastern Ontario Health Unit on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 In its regular update on Tuesday, the EOHU indicated the testing laboratory set up at CFB Trenton would now be moving to the Nav Centre as the people quarantined in Trenton reached the end of their 14-day stay and were released. The daily update also indicated one person at the Nav Centre was transported to Cornwall Community Hospital on Monday for medical reasons unrelated to the COVID-19. “There were transfers of quarantined individuals to hospitals in Trenton for medical reasons not related to COVID-19, and we do expect them here as well,” Roumeliotis is quoted as saying in the update— though he did not volunteer this information during his update to city council Monday. All precautions were taken by Cornwall-SDG EMS in transporting the person, and the Cornwall Community Hospital is equipped and prepared to isolate the person while providing treatment. If well enough to be released before the 14-day quarantine is lifted, the person would return to the Nav Centre. During his presentation, Roumeliotis praised the quarantine area, calling it an ideal location, being completely walled off and having a tunnel leading to it. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking to Nav employees,” he said. “I know that some are worried. I’m also getting phone calls from schools saying that kids are being bullied now because their parents work at the Nav. Some parents are refusing to send their kids to daycares and to schools because their parents are working at the Nav Centre.”

It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

39,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unece-releases-statistical-portrait-of-regions-sdg-progress/,"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNECE Releases Statistical Portrait of Region’s SDG Progress,"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has launched a first regional report on SDG progress. The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

The UNECE Statistical Division prepared the first annual SDG progress report to inform the 2020 RFSD. The 2020 RFSD virtual meeting will take place on 19 March 2020, per this update on changes to UNECE meetings due to COVID-19.

40,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/asia-pacific-off-track-20-of-sdg-indicators-predicted-to-be-worse-in-2030/,"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Asia-Pacific Off Track: 20% of SDG Indicators Predicted to be Worse in 2030,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has released its annual SDG progress report, finding that the region’s performance is “poor” on most measurable environmental targets. The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.

Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones. In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework. She also provided an oral update to the report, noting that on indicator 3.8.1, the refinement has been changed to “coverage of essential health services,” meaning that the indicator “basically goes back to what it was before.”

She also highlighted that:

The IAEG proposes establishing a working group for measuring development support more broadly than through official development assistance (ODA) – “total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD)”. An additional indicator on TOSSD had been proposed during the comprehensive review process, but members differed over the methodology. The Group agreed to work further on this potential indicator for submission to the Commission in 2022, and to establish a working group to this end.

Data disaggregation is a main area of work for 2020, to ensure “no one is left behind,” and the IEAG aims to develop guidelines on tools and methodologies on data disaggregation and to help build national capacity; and

The Group has issued a report on interlinkages between the Goals and targets both statistically and through a policy and legislation lens, to support deeper analysis of the 2030 Agenda.

Member States, some of whom are IAEG members, made numerous remarks. Several welcomed the fact that the changes to the framework had been limited so as not to increase the overall burden on national statistical organizations, while increasing the quality of the framework. Some expressed support for specific changes, such as the addition of an indicator on civil justice (16.3.3), the additional of an indicator on total greenhouse gas emissions per year (indicator 13.2.2), and in a revision to indicator 15.9.1, the integration of biodiversity into national accounting under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.

Speakers expressed concern on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on employment in sustainable tourism.

On other changes, the speakers expressed concern, including on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on the proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs. China voiced concern about, among others, the addition of the GHG emissions indicator, noting that the global response to climate change should focus on equity and preserve each country’s equal right to development.

The United Arab Emirates suggested “cancelling” all indicators that remain in Tier 3, given the relatively short time left to implement them. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) lamented the lack of an indicator for older persons under SDG target 2.2. on malnutrition.

The African Group recommended reinforced collaboration and coordination with regional commissions. Others called for improved coordination between the custodian agencies for the indicators and national governments.

Revisiting the discussion on 6 March 2020 with the aim of approving the Commission’s report on the proposed changes (E/CN3/2020/L.3, draft decision 1), many delegations reiterated their concern about deleting indicator 8.9.2 on sustainable tourism employment.

The Director of the UN Statistics Division Stefan Schweinfest recalled that the comprehensive review process had been lengthy and “very complex” and had resulted in a “package deal.” This would make reconsidering the decision on one indicator a “dangerous path,” he said, urging delegations to accept the premise of a compromise. Speaking on the “painful” impacts of deleting 8.9.2, Suriname urged that the report reflect that “part of the Commission does not accept this…. Some countries are saying this is not okay.”

The report of the IAEG was adopted as orally revised, and it “agreed to and adopted the proposed major changes and minor refinements … while noting concerns regarding specific indicators, and recognized that the work on SDG indicators is work in progress.” The amended text also indicates that the IAEG is requested to continue its annual refinement, research and methodological work including on “policy issues such as sustainable tourism and climate change.”

Another oral revision to the report adds wording on “the importance of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for SDG monitoring.”

At the closing of the 51st session, Commission Chair Shigeru Kawasaki (Japan) expressed satisfaction that “the SDG indicator framework is advancing, although there is still some room for improvement … we are in a very promising situation.” [Meeting webcast, 3 March 2020] [Meeting webcast, 6 March 2020]","The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs.
The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).
The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.
Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones.
In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework."

In some areas, work is shifting to alternative virtual formats, such as the UN’s Fifth Committee on administrative and budgetary matters.

By early March, a number of announcements regarding the postponement or cancellation of meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic had been made. The UN Commission on the Status of Women held a historically short meeting for its 64th session, convening for a half-day on 9 March 2020 to adopt a political declaration before suspending. The CSW usually brings together thousands of participants the world for a two-week session and hundreds of side events.

Also acting early to adjust major plans were the World Bank and IMF, which transitioned the annual Spring Meetings scheduled for mid-April to a virtual format. The World Bank announced that it would cancel or postpone “all major events and conferences until further notice,” including the cancellation of the 2020 Land and Poverty Conference scheduled for 16-20 March. In cancelling the 19th session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which was scheduled for April 2020, members of the Forum noted the “already precarious health situation that many indigenous peoples live in, and the imperative to avoid adverse impacts.”

On 10 March, the ECOSOC Youth Forum and a Youth Plenary in preparation for the UN’s 75th anniversary were postponed. On 11 March, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to postpone the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 4) on an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), with new dates to be determined (decision 74/543). IGC 4 had been scheduled to convene from 23 March to 3 April. UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also announced that two high-level events would not go forward: the High-level Interactive Panel on Anti-microbial Resistance, scheduled for 14 April 2020; and the High-level event to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, scheduled for 24 April 2020.

On 11 March, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) circulated a list of proposed changes to the Council’s meeting calendar, inviting Member States’ views. She subsequently announced instead, “we need to remain flexible.”

On 17 March, the UNGA President announced that in-person, formal meetings of the UNGA “should not be organized at this time.” He suggested that the UNGA adopt any essential decisions via silence procedure, and agreeing on a simple procedure for postponing meetings. By a separate letter, he said he had decided to cancel all in-person meetings of the UNGA’s mandated processes for the 74th session that are scheduled to be held up to 17 April 2020, stating that, “These processes will conduct their activities via alternative mechanisms.” On mandated UNGA events scheduled for after 17 April 2020, he said discussions are ongoing.

The UNGA President said officials are considering alternative ways to adopt key decisions (instead of in-person meetings), and that the UNGA’s Fifth Committee has “successfully started conducting informal meetings via the UN’s Video Conference Tool (VCT).” ECOSOC, too, is exploring virtual options and solutions, according to the President’s statement on 18 March.

Additional ECOSOC meetings and events have been postponed or cancelled, as follows:

The 19th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), 30 March-3 April: Postponed

2020 ECOSOC Partnership Forum, 3 April: Cancelled

2020 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum), 20-23 April: Postponed until after April 2020

SDG Investment Fair, 20-22 April: Cancelled

Other ECOSOC meetings that fall within the eight-week timeframe are:

The UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), 4-8 May; and

The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum), 12-13 May.

Later in May, the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) is scheduled for 14-15 May, and the ECOSOC segment on Operational Activities for Development (OAS) is planned to convene from 19-21 May.

Negotiations on outcome documents of upcoming meetings, such as the ministerial declaration of the HLPF/high-level segment of ECOSOC in July 2020, may not take place in person.

Four out of five of the UN regions have had to postpone their annual regional fora for sustainable development or switch to a virtual format. The exception is the UN Economic Commission for Africa, which convened the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) from 24-27 February 2020. These regional sessions comprise an important part of the preparations for the July session of the HLPF.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) has been organizing preparations for the fifth UN conference on the LDCs, which will convene in Qatar in 2021 (UNLDC-V). Regional review meetings to inform these preparations have been postponed both for Africa, in Malawi, and Asia-Pacific, in Bangladesh.

On climate change, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is not organizing in-person meetings until the end of April 2020 and official missions have been suspended. The regional climate weeks have been postponed, as has the 2020 NAP Expo among other planned meetings. The Adaptation Committee will meet virtually instead of its in-person meeting from 24-27 March.

On biodiversity, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced the postponement of a number of meetings, including the 24th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice of the CBD and the third Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation of the CBD. Both of these meetings are expected to feed into the preparations for the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is scheduled to take place in October 2020, in China and is expected to adopt a global biodiversity framework for the post-2020 period.

On chemicals and waste management, the fourth meeting of the intersessional process for Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 was postponed, having been scheduled to convene in Bucharest, Romania, from 23-27 March 2020. The meeting will feed into the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), which is scheduled to take place from 5-9 October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.

44,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/report-evaluates-tuvalus-progress-towards-improving-waste-management/,"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Report Evaluates Tuvalu’s Progress towards Improving Waste Management,"The Government of Tuvalu has published the second annual review of the implementation status of the country’s Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026. The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite implementation challenges, there is evidence of “significant progress” in several areas, including waste management.

The ‘Tuvalu Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026’ is the main national policy framework to guide the management of waste in the country with the vision of having “A Cleaner and Healthier Tuvalu for today and future generations.”

The Policy and Action Plan acknowledges that its development is a “timely response to the significant changes happening in the waste sector in the Pacific Region and globally.” These changes include an increase in waste generated on the islands that has come about due to a proliferation of consumption of “more wasteful imported products,” according to the Plan. Excess waste presents a significant challenge, considering the “extremely limited land mass” of atoll countries such as Tuvalu.

The Policy and Action Plan, endorsed by the Government of Tuvalu in 2016, consists of six goals:

Strengthened institutional systems to address gaps in waste management;

The stakeholders fully understand the merits of proper waste management and co-share the responsibility of managing waste;

Establish strong public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the delivery of waste services;

Delivered waste services follow best practice and are cost-effective;

Enhanced capacity of waste practitioners; and

Waste activity outcomes are reported and disseminated to relevant stakeholders.

The last goal of the Policy and Action Plan is achieved, in part, through the conduct of annual reviews of the implementation status of the Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan. Since 2016, two annual reviews have been conducted. The latest one was released in May 2019, and covers the period from January 2018 to March 2019.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite challenges to implementation of the Waste Policy and Action Plan, there is evidence of “significant progress” especially on goals two, three, and five due to the Department of Waste Management elevating these to the national level with the support of key stakeholders. The report also outlines progress on achieving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as: review existing waste-related legislation and merge into one Act; develop specific regulations to support strict enforcement of the new waste legislation; allocate reasonable budget for waste services; implement public awareness programmes involving communities and schools in all waste service areas in the Tuvaluan language; reduce occupational and public health and safety incidents by 50%; 100% coverage of collection in the main island and at least 80% coverage of collection in the outer islands; and exploration and participation in information exchange programmes with other countries within and outside the region.

Tuvalu is aiming to transform towards a circular economy as the country sees it as the only way to address the increasing amount of waste that ends up in landfills annually and to achieve SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols. To do so, Tuvalu is strengthening engagement with the private sector in order to explore opportunities to reduce the amount of disposable waste and to ensure that all recyclable waste is shipped overseas for proper treatment and processing.

Tuvalu is also actively engaged in the EU-funded Pacific Waste Management Programme (PacWastePlus), implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), to further strengthen the country’s waste management. This project especially focuses on e-waste streams as a national waste priority, and provides technical assistance in Tuvalu’s transition towards a circular economy. The PacWastePlus programme, which is working with 14 Pacific countries and Timor-Leste, has a strong focus on improving data collection, information sharing, and education and awareness. The project also works with countries on developing and implementing policies and regulatory frameworks, implementing best practices to enhance private sector engagement and infrastructure development, and human capacity.

Yet the 2019 Annual Review recognizes that the enforcement of government waste management-related legislation, regulations, and policies is “generally weak,” which is related to a lack public awareness and education programmes carried out thus far. The report outlines emergent waste issues of importance for Tuvalu such as marine litter, healthcare waste, asbestos, and sewage and sludge. To mitigate these emergent issues, the Annual Review recommends the incorporation in the refined action plan 2017-2021 of measures, including:

Enforcement of law on illegal dumping along the coastline;

Regular monitoring of ships’ compliance with waste management standards;

Enforcement of law on littering;

Putting in place a proper healthcare waste management system;

Public awareness and education on asbestos features and their locations in Tuvalu;

Installation of a proper treatment system for sewage and sludge; and

Women groups taking the lead on addressing illegal dumping and littering problems.

Finally, the Annual Review cautions that, due to the nature of the policy goals, it will take time to realize some of the impacts, particularly those related to the need to change people’s attitudes to waste.

Negotiations on the framework are expected to culminate at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China, in October 2020.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Strategic Plan 2011-2020, which lays out the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, is rapidly approaching its 2020 expiration date. As a result, the Open-ended Intersessional Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was developed and has been tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the framework.

As the Earth Negotiations Bulletin analysis of the meeting indicates, the charge to “develop an all-encompassing framework that includes, in addition to addressing direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss and rapid species extinction, a plethora of considerations, such as ecosystem health, nature’s contributions to people, human health, socio-economic concerns, trade concerns, human rights considerations, new technologies, indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs), gender issues, intergenerational concerns, and education, among others, is by definition an extremely daunting task.”

The first meeting of the Working Group, which took place on 27-30 August 2019, at the UN Office at Nairobi, Kenya, agreed that the Co-Chairs and the CBD Bureau would develop a zero draft text on the global biodiversity framework; the zero draft was released in January 2020.

The second meeting of the Working Group took place from 24-29 February 2020, at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) in Rome, Italy. On the opening day participants were challenged to focus on implementation, raise ambition in goals and targets, provide financial and other means of implementation, and develop mechanisms to hold each other accountable and review progress. In his opening remarks to the Working Group, Hamdallah Zedan, Egypt’s Ministry of Environment, speaking on behalf of President of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 14), also underlined the need for the global biodiversity framework to provide a detailed plan of action to reduce biodiversity loss, which he stressed is taking place at an alarming rate and requires urgent response.

Working Group participants commented on the zero draft of the framework. At the conclusion of the meeting, participants:

invited the 24th meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical, and Technological Advice (SBSTTA 24) to provide elements for the development of the global biodiversity framework for consideration by the third Working Group meeting, which is scheduled to take place in July;

invited SBSTTA to provide a scientific and technical review of updated goals and targets, and related indicators and baselines;

requested the Working Group Co-Chairs and the Secretariat to prepare a document, updating the elements of the draft framework that were reviewed during the second meeting of the Working Group;

requested the Secretariat to provide scientific and technical information to support SBSTTA’s review, including an analysis of linkages with the SDGs; and

requested the Working Group Co-Chairs and the Secretariat to prepare a first draft of the global biodiversity framework.

46,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/icao-identifies-six-eligible-carbon-offsetting-programmes-for-aviation-industry/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICAO Identifies Six Eligible Carbon-Offsetting Programmes for Aviation Industry,"Recent meetings organized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), addressed steps by ICAO to address the aviation industry’s negative environmental externalities.

At the ICAO Council meeting, which convened from 2-20 March 2020, in Montréal, Canada, the Council adopted a standard to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health, and took further decisions on implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA is a market-based mechanism adopted in 2016 to achieve ICAO’s goals of increasing fuel efficiency by 2% per year and carbon-neutral growth of civil aviation from 2020 onwards. The mechanism aims to cap aviation’s future emissions growth by obliging airlines to buy offsets, rather than reducing their aircraft emissions.

The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase. These six programmes are:

American Carbon Registry

China Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Voluntary Emission Reduction Program

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Climate Action Reserve

The Gold Standard

Verified Carbon Standard

The Council’s decision follows recommendations by the Technical Advisory Body (TAB), which it established and tasked with evaluating whether carbon-offsetting programs satisfy the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). Public comments were also received, including from experts at Europe-based research institutes Öko-Institut, Perspectives, and Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), who published their analysis of 14 carbon-offsetting programs in October 2019.

In accordance with TAB’s recommendations on “eligibility timeframe” and “unit date eligibility,” the emissions units are issued to activities that commenced as of 1 January 2016, and in respect of emissions reductions occurring through 31 December 2020, subject to each programme’s scope of eligibility. The list of eligible emissions units will eventually be publicly available on the ICAO CORSIA website.

In its assessment and recommendation of programmes, TAB highlighted the following criteria:

Permanence: Carbon offset credits must represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or carbon sequestration that are permanent, whereby any given risk of reductions or removals being reversed require that either such credits are not eligible or measures are in place to monitor, mitigate, and compensate incidences of material leakage.

Additionality: Carbon offset programmes must generate units that represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or removals that are additional, including that they exceed any GHG reduction or removals required by law, regulation, or legally binding mandate.

Avoidance of double counting towards mitigation obligations: Measures must be in place to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming such as could occur by claims from both an airline and the host country of the emissions reduction activity.

Monitoring, reporting and verification: Emissions reduction is calculated in a conservative and transparent manner, verified by an accredited independent entity prior to issuance of offset credits, which should be based on accurate measurements and monitored on a regular basis.

Public disclosure of sustainable development: A programme should list the criteria used regarding alignment with the SDGs.

The selected programmes performed differently, and none perfectly against all EUCs, the TAB recommendations and expert submissions reveal. TAB underscores that various programmes “made substantial progress” towards addressing certain shortcomings, or have “indicated willingness to put in place measures to ensure consistency with the EUCs.” Still, experts proposed that programmes be approved only provisionally until they satisfy all EUCs, to avoid risks for CORSIA’s integrity. Experts also called on ICAO to provide further clarity on which global warming potential values the programmes should use when issuing CORSIA eligible offset credits.

The January 2020 report from TAB recommends that the Council request from most of the eligible carbon-offsetting programs further specified actions following its decision, with the exception of the CDM. This is because the future of registered CDM activities is still being negotiated in the context of the rules, modalities, procedures, and guidelines for Article 6 (cooperative approaches) of the Paris Agreement on climate change. International guidance on the transition of the CDM is needed since all participating Paris Agreement parties will have to correspondingly adjust their emission levels and targets upon transfer of mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting.

On using carbon offset credits under CORSIA, experts hope that Paris Agreement parties will provide clarity on:

How emission reductions not covered by Parties’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) should be treated;

What key elements are necessary for letters of attestation and authorization by host countries to confirm avoidance of double counting so the units can be used under CORSIA;

How additionality of activities can be proven; and

What actions should trigger corresponding adjustments to account for the use of offset credits under CORSIA.

The ICAO Council also improved its environmental standards to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health. Environmental and health impact assessments of aircraft engine emissions rely on Particulate Matter (PM) characteristics such as number, size, and composition, but reported PM emissions data varied due to different sampling protocols and methodologies used. For emission certification purposes, measurement methodologies needed to be standardized. Engine manufacturers use certification of aircraft engines for non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions.

At its March 2020 meeting, the ICAO Council adopted a “non-volatile PM (nvPM) mass and number Standard” for aircraft engines. The standard applies to engine designs of rated thrust greater than 26.7 Kilonewton and will govern both new and in-production engines from 2023 onwards. ICAO aims to ensure that only the most effective nvPM reduction technologies are employed in post-2023 aircraft engine designs.","The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase.

The report aims to inform the region’s progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

It followed on the heels of the 33rd African Union (AU) Summit, which focused on the 2020 theme, ‘Silencing the Guns: Creating conducive conditions for Africa’s Development.’

Addressing the overarching theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ the sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD 2020), was also the first regional consultation to take place under the UN@75 reform process. On the margins of the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General (UNDSG) Amina Mohammed convened several consultations with regional stakeholders, including UN and AU institutions, and youth, to elicit perspectives from on the ongoing UN reform process.

ARFSD 2020 took place from 24-27 February 2020, in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. It was co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the AU Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN system. It brought together nearly 3,000 delegates in plenary and parallel sessions over the four days, holding more than 60 preparatory and side events.

The Regional Forum assessed Africa’s progress on all 17 SDGs, clustered around the “five Ps” of the 2030 Agenda: people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnerships. Drawing on regional data sources – including the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2020, and the inaugural AU Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063 – there was a convergence of evidence that, despite some pockets of progress, the region is off track on both global and regional goals.

Forum participants engaged in in-depth discussion of key findings and lessons from a selection of VNRs currently being conducted by 17 African countries for presentation at the HLPF in July 2020, as well as emerging lessons from voluntary local reviews (VLRs), which featured for the first time at the Forum. A recurring theme in the discussions was the need to address weak national and local capacity in accessing and using quality and relevant data. Underscoring the importance of building VNRs on evidence-based local reviews, the Forum proposed developing a template to support country reporting. Accelerators for delivering a transformed and prosperous Africa, including through leveraging science, technology and innovation (STI), and strengthening partnerships with the UN Development System, major groups, youth, and other stakeholders were also highlighted.

The Forum adopted a ministerial declaration, titled, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ as well as an outcome summary report and key messages containing Africa’s priorities and policy measures to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

Addressing the negative impact of the climate crisis, Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), cited estimates that some countries are spending the equivalent of 2-3% of their GDP on unplanned responses to weather and climate impacts. Touching on repercussions for the water, energy, conflict, food security, and hydropower production sectors, she highlighted efforts underway to craft a common regional position on this issue for the 2020 UN Climate Conference.

During the 33rd AU Summit, which took place from 8-9 February, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the AU-UN strategic partnership is growing “ever stronger and more dynamic,” and highlighted interlinkages between the ‘Silencing the Guns’ initiative with targets on human rights, gender equality, climate change, and sustainable development. With an estimated tripling of armed conflicts over the past decade, despite implementation of a peace and security roadmap, the discussions underscored the importance of good governance, and building more inclusive societies.

Incoming AU Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined regional priorities to achieve the Agenda 2063, including, supporting regional integration, industrialization, and trade and investment, and strengthening women’s economic empowerment, in line with the launch of the AU Decade of Financial Inclusion for Women. The Summit adopted enhanced commitments towards this end, including plans to allocate 25% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, and the launch of the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF), which aims to provide capital to both first time and experienced fund managers, to invest in majority female-owned businesses.

The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators from across all 17 Goals.

The UNECE Dashboard for SDGs was launched on 13 March 2020, ahead of UNECE’s Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFSD will only convene for a half-day, online meeting on 19 March 2020.

Data disaggregation remains a major gap in monitoring the SDGs.

The Dashboard draws on data from the UN Global SDG Database. The 80 indicators included in the dashboard are listed at the indicator menu page.

The Dashboard allows users to:

See “snapshots” by country, and compare countries;

View differences between women and men;

Create graphs and maps; and

Access definitions and explanations.

Users can download full datasets for more in-depth analysis.

Announcing the launch of the Dashboard, UNECE notes that a major gap in monitoring the SDGs is data disaggregation. Although the 2030 Agenda calls for examining indicators for specific population groups – broken up by sex, age, ethnicity, as well as migratory, disability and/or indigenous status – data collection still must be significantly increased to make this possible. UNECE reports that “to date, the only disaggregation offered in the UNECE dashboard is by sex, where possible with the currently-available data.”

UNECE adds that it is working to improve measurement in areas of the SDGs that are particularly hard to measure, including disaggregated poverty measurement, migration statistics, environmental statistics and indicators, climate change-related statistics, and statistics on children and youth.

51,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-imperative-of-ending-wildlife-crime/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Imperative of Ending Wildlife Crime,"Reports that the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated from illegally sourced wildlife, including pangolin, has given a new sense of urgency to ending wildlife crime. Wildlife crime is not new, yet, remarkably, there is no global legal agreement addressing it. This is despite the devastating impact it has on wildlife, local communities, national economies, security, public health and entire ecosystems, and its links to HIV Aids, Ebola, SARS, MERS and now COVID -19.

We are not talking about subsistence poaching, which is a separate and distinct issue to be resolved locally, but rather, large-scale criminal activity organized transnationally and fueled by corruption. A recent World Bank report estimates the value of illegally traded species at US$200 billion, when all wildlife, including fish and timber not listed under CITES are included.

Saving wildlife, and, as we now see, ourselves, means stopping an illegal commerce that shifts thousands of tonnes of contraband, worth billions of dollars and leaves death, destruction, and instability in its wake. Ending wildlife crime requires a new level of international cooperation that assures criminals feel the long arm of the law. The time for bold action is now.

No longer a tenable solution

Currently and by default, we have turned to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a trade-related conservation convention from the 1970’s, to serve as the de facto legal instrument for combating serious wildlife crimes. The problem is that CITES wasn’t designed to deal with wildlife crime. It was meant to regulate wildlife trade to avoid over-exploitation of threatened species.

While a critically important trade convention, it was never designed to fight crime. CITES has its limitations. It only applies to species listed in its appendices – that is 36,000 of the world’s eight million species – and to the cross-border movement of specimens. It doesn’t require illegal trade to be criminalized, nor does it apply to poaching. However, in the absence of any alternative, over the past decade, CITES has been leveraged to crank up the fight against illegal wildlife trade.

Even with its limitations, CITES has had some success in this regard. It led the creation of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in 2010[i], which was welcomed by CITES Parties in 2013[ii]. In parallel to the Consortium, the UN General Assembly passed a first-ever Resolution on Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2015, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) released the first-ever UN World Wildlife Crime Report in 2016. Over the years, CITES has seen the deeper engagement of police and customs agents, and action by key industry sectors, including finance, transport, and tourism.

Yet, a serious underlying problem remains, one for which we are now paying a heavy price. There is no international legal framework for cooperative global and national action to catch and punish serious wildlife criminals, nor is there an agreed definition of wildlife crime. This inhibits global enforcement efforts and jeopardizes the lives of park rangers, creates insecurity and undermines conservation schemes. It robs local communities of their resources and it elevates the risk of future disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

Transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

Given the scale and seriousness of wildlife crime and its grave implications for countries, their ecosystems and species, and for humanity overall, it can and must be dealt with by police, prosecutors and the judiciary – not by individuals such as conservationists or park rangers acting alone. We need an unequivocal political message, supported by the right legal framework, that organized, transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

We must move with the times

The time has come for a new global agreement on wildlife crime.

This agreement can be housed under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC), as has been done for other serious crimes such as human trafficking. Such an agreement should oblige countries to prohibit the import of any wildlife[iii], supported by criminal sanctions, unless the importer can prove it was legally obtained[iv].

This idea was put forward at the recent ‘End Wildlife Crime’ event at the House of Lords, which promoted a new agreement on wildlife crime that criminalizes the importation, distribution and consumption of illegally sourced wildlife. What is proposed is not unlike the approach taken in some countries, such as in the US under the Lacey Act, and what some countries have in place for certain timber imports.

Doing things differently requires us to take a fresh look at historic approaches to conservation and question their ongoing efficacy in a changing world. Making bold but necessary changes will prove difficult and stir up resistance. But the status quo won’t do; nor will incremental changes. It’s abundantly clear that we need to scale up the fight against the transnational, organized criminals who are stripping countries bare of their precious wildlife and creating havoc locally and globally. To stop them we need to get police and prosecutors hot on their trail.

Global responses to biodiversity loss must move with the times and if we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organized criminals, while opening up new opportunities for local communities in and around biodiverse-rich areas, then we will not only end wildlife crime but see wildlife, ecosystems and local communities thrive.

Along with the NISSAP, an outline for a Proposed Eradication of Feral Cats from Malden Island and Guidelines for Monitoring Birds and Invasive Species at Kiritimati have been developed.

The efforts to address invasive alien species outlined in these documents are important for reaching SDG Target 15.8 on introducing measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and controlling or eradicating the priority species by 2020. They also contribute to achieving Article 5.1 of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols on ensuring sound environmental management and development of natural resources.

According to the ‘Guidelines for Monitoring Birds and Invasive Species at Kiritimati, Kiribati,’ the country is home to a diverse flora and fauna, including 21 breeding sea bird species, many of which are considered globally important and two of which are under threat of extinction, in part due to invasive species, including two species of rat and feral cats. Other threats to sea birds include poaching, pollutants from commercial fishing and potential impacts of climate change on food availability and the quality of nesting areas.

The Guidelines were initially created by the Wildlife Conservation Unit in 2012 and updated in 2018, with support from conservation biologists Pierce, Brown and VanderWerf to help manage and monitor birds and invasive species on Kiritimati. These efforts are especially important for the Kiritimati populations of endangered species such as the Phoenix Petrel (Te Ruru), the White-throated Storm-Petrel (Te Bwebwe ni Marawa), and the vulnerable Christmas Island Warbler (Te Bokikokiko), with Kiritimati being the stronghold for all three of these species.

The NISSAP outlines previous successes regarding the removal of invasive species throughout Kiribati. For example, the removal of rats from two of the PIPA islands and many islets within the Kiritimati lagoon have resulted in locally improved nesting productivity and greater seabird numbers.

Despite the successes, the NISSAP notes that resources are limited, and there is a need to ensure that efforts are well-directed and effective “towards achieving a sustainable livelihood for people and environmental values.” [Publication: National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan 2015-2020] [Kiribati Environment Data Portal] [Pacific Environment Portal]

Landsvirkjun has signed an agreement with US and UK institutional investors to issue USD 80 million senior unsecured notes in the US Private Placement (“USPP”) market. The issue reiterates Landsvirkjun’s focus on sustainability-linked financing, linking the pricing of the notes to the company’s carbon sequestration targets, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 13 on climate action.

The offering was very well received, with an order book which was multiple times oversubscribed. The attractiveness of this funding opportunity was enhanced by the ability of the US and UK investors to provide short-dated notes in a favourable rate environment. The notes have a 3-year maturity and carry a fixed interest rate of 2.51%, with semi-annual payments. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

The issuance demonstrates Landsvirkjun’s continued commitment and focus on sustainable development and follows the execution of a USD 150 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2019 and the successful placing of a USD 200 million green bond in the USPP market in 2018.





First European SDG-linked USPP

Landsvirkjun is the first issuer in Europe of an SDG-linked USPP. The USPP is understood to be one of the first SDG-linked issuances in Europe overall and underscores Landsvirkjun’s innovation and leadership in this fast-moving space.

As part of the transaction, Landsvirkjun has committed to increase its carbon sequestration efforts to reach at least 32,538 tons of CO 2 eq. for 2020 (up by at least 2% from 31,900 tons CO 2 eq. for 2019). The USPP is directly tied to this commitment whereas the annual coupon will increase by 10 bps if Landsvirkjun fails to achieve this target. The target forms part of Landsvirkjun’s strategy to become carbon neutral by 2025.

Barclays acted as Sole Placement Agent in this transaction. Landsvirkjun’s legal advisors were Logos and Morrison & Foerster. The funders’ legal advisor was Greenberg Traurig.





Hörður Arnarson, CEO of Landsvirkjun:

“We are pleased with our second successful issuance in the USPP market and the support that we have received from our investor group. The private placement provides further diversification of funding sources and demonstrates our ability to access financing on attractive terms. As sustainability and the environment are core to our social responsibility initiatives, we are proud to have issued the first SDG-linked USPP in Europe, which further reinforces our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.”

The report states that this SDG target “will be missed,” underscoring the need to increase “efforts to generate decent jobs for the next generation of workers.”

The report titled, ‘Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Technology and the Future of Jobs,’ highlights that the number of young people classified as NEET has risen from 259 million in 2016 to 267 million in 2019, and is expected to continue increasing to approximately 273 million in 2021. Young women are twice as likely as young men to face precarious employment situations, and two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women. The gender gap is even more pronounced in the Arab States and Southern Asia, where cultural and social norms are more likely to prevent women from pursuing education or working outside the house. Youth unemployment also varies by region, from 30% in Northern Africa to less than 9% in Northern America.

Two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women.

The report finds that a narrow focus on vocational training, a lack of jobs to match qualifications, and increasing automation are creating a “precarious future in the labor market” for young people. Employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are at greater risk of losing their jobs because of further technological advances than older workers.

The report also identifies challenges with vocational training, which tends to impart occupation-specific skills that become obsolete faster than general education skills. As a result, employees with vocational training are even more vulnerable. To address these concerns, the report calls for modernizing vocational training programmes to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy.

Young people who complete tertiary education are less likely to lose jobs to automation. However, the increase in the number of young people with degrees has outpaced the demand for graduate labor, resulting in falling returns to tertiary education and pushing down wages for graduates. The report addresses a number of additional challenges, including informal and less secure forms of employment and a digital divide between regions and generations.

The report recommends an integrated policy framework to support young people’s ascent into decent jobs and to assure that new technologies positively impact on youth employment. The report argues for policies to generate a sufficient number of decent jobs, to equip young people with the skills needed for those jobs, and ensure social protection for workers.

The ILO also produced briefing notes on youth employment trends by region.

The ABN Amro Candriam Emerging Markets Sustainable Bonds fund aims to primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of hard currency sovereign bonds and achieve medium-term capital growth.

This best-in-universe strategy includes environmental, social and governance (ESG) research and analysis of country-specific ESG indicators.

Selection process

Bonds are selected by applying first an SRI screening, to rank countries in terms of their sustainable development.

The worst-rated countries are excluded to create the investable universe.

The fund managers then decide about the level of exposure to issuers and relative risk by using both financial and non-financial variables.

They implement the most compelling relative value opportunities based on level of conviction and liquidity.

The selection is readjusted according to ABN Amro Investment Solutions’ sustainable criteria and countries’ exclusion list.

SDG philosophy

The portfolio managers said that credit analysis alone is not sufficient to evaluate the long-term performance of sovereign debt.

By assessing the pathway of a country towards the SDGs, they believe that they can evaluate a nation’s sustainable development and ‘true’ risk profile.

Sustainable nations reduce sovereign risk because they pursue economic development without compromising the needs of future generations, they added.

It’s not the tweet of the robin. Ditto Roll Up the Rim.

Instead, it’s the ushering in of half-load season on select county and local roads. Half-load season is just that, the limiting of materials to five tonnes per axle on the weaker roads located throughout the region.



Roads that are subject to seasonal weight restrictions are identified with a sign. Half-loads will be enforced once signs are posted, which started March 6, 2020 and will likely run into the early part of May.

Except the following locations, most roads within SDG are subject to half-load restrictions:

– South of Highway 401 on County Road Nos. 1, 14, 33 and 35.

– County Road 15 from County Road 2 to the southwest leg of County Road 36.

– County Road 44 from Highway No. 138 to 840m East of County Road 42

– County Road Nos. 31, 34, 43, 46

– County Road No. 2 from Leeds & Grenville boundary to the City of Cornwall boundary and from the City of Cornwall boundary to the Ontario/Quebec boundary.

Benjamin de-Haan, the director of transportation and planning for the county, said half-load season is integral to the long-term sustainability of the road infrastructure within the county – the biggest municipal roads system in the entire province.

“We strive to ensure we allow for the transportation of goods across the county, while at the same time putting measures in place to protect the investment taxpayers have made in our infrastructure,” he said. “These kinds of measures are important to the bottom line of the county, as well as the effective use of taxpayer dollars.”

Why are these measures so important? Try to think of a road like a giant sandwich buried in the ground with layers that are important to the overall flavour of the road. When you add an extra ingredient – like water – your sandwich can become a mess.

The base of the road begins at its deepest point with the sub-grade material, which is typically native material or imported fill. On top of this layer is aggregate material of varying sizes of crushed stone and other granulars that are packed into place. Finally the whole thing is topped with asphalt.

The problem comes in the late winter and early spring when the heat of the sun can warm the asphalt base to several degrees above freezing, while the ambient air temperature can often be well below zero. As snow and ice melts, it can permeate the asphalt in areas. When that water refreezes, say after sunset or doing an especially cold day, the ice and trapped water will weaken the strength of the road.

By restricting the amount of weight a vehicle carries, the damage to weakened roads can be mitigated.

“Half-load season is an effective means to protect our roads,” said de-Haan. “It won’t be long before the weather warms even more, and we will remove the restrictions.”

The rate of women at the top in Tanzania make up 8 percent of the country's CEOs. It may take some more years for the east African country to keep women in high-level management positions equally during the global peak hours when employers and organizations are trying to crush the deeply-rooted patriarchal traditions.

Employment and salaries lower for women than men

Females in Tanzania form a larger share of the working age population. Women account for 52 percent of the working age population (15 years and over), but labour force participation rate is higher among males (89.4 percent) than among females (84.2 percent). The gender gap in labour force participation increases with rising education level. Among women, the unemployment rates are higher than those of men in all areas, particularly in the capital Dar es Salaam. Albeit unemployment is comparable among men and women, the difference is higher in rural areas compared to urban areas as the majority of women there are unemployed.

In Tanzania, men are more likely to be employed in formal sectors including government service than women. The country has a big gender gap in terms of monthly income between men and women. Even in agriculture, women's monthly income is almost half in comparison to men. Subsistence farming is a source of livelihood for more than 80 percent women, although only 27 percent own land. Unfortunately, women still face discrimination in the labour market in terms of wages, promotions and legal protections followed by confronting harassment in the workplace.

According to the Tanzania Human Rights Report 2017 (by the US Department of State), women have the same status as men under labour law on the mainland. The report states that gender-based discrimination in terms of wages, promotions, and legal protections in employment continues to occur in the private sector (based on the Trade Union Congress of Tanzania). The report also states that women often are employed for low pay and in hazardous jobs, and they report high levels of bullying, threats and sexual harassment.

Petition at Parliament for men to pay 'salary' to their wives

Maybe as a consequential outcome of this kind of reasons, the Regional Commissioner of Tanzania's Dar es Salaam city, Paul Makonda has recently announced his intention to petition at the Parliament to introduce a bill. He does not want women to be frustrated due to lack of money.

Paul Makonda is set to petition at the Parliament for introducing a bill that seeks to have 40 percent of men's monthly salary deducted and credited to their wives' bank accounts. According to the local media, he made the pledge of giving justice to the women in Kinondoni, Dar es Salaam during the International Women's Day celebration.

""I will petition the National Assembly to introduce a law that will see 40 percent of salaries of men in formal employment deducted and credited to the bank accounts of their spouses who are housewives,"" he said.

According to him, there is a requirement for stringent law that compel men to accept that their wives would be the sole custodians of their property if they (men) die before their spouses. The 38-year-old Regional Commissioner is set to resolve the problems of widows camping at his office seeking intervention after losing their rights upon demise of their husbands. For good measure, he has already introduced a hotline toll-free number, which he said, 'depressed' women could use to seek assistance from his office.

Plight of single mothers likely to be partially solved

The Regional Commissioner has also suggested single mothers to avoid instilling the sense of hostility in their children's minds on their deadbeat fathers. He said this would stop deceitful married men from sexually preying on unsuspecting single women. ""You will find a single mum talking so negatively about her deadbeat ex-partner. One thing that woman should know is that the child wasn't there when she and her partner first met,"" he said.

""It is therefore wise to face your struggles alone, and don't involve the children. Your toxic talk could have a near-permanent impact on the children, especially your girls who shun getting into heterosexual relationships because – based on what their mothers told them – they (girls) might think that all men are heartbreakers,"" the Regional Commissioner, who is well-known for giving efforts to empower women, opined.

Single mothers in rural Tanzania confront typical struggles due to lack of education and awareness. They are not aware properly of their rights and values as human beings. Many women believe that once they become pregnant and their men abandon them, they lose their dignity totally. The situation is worse in some communities where women are stigmatized for being single mothers. However, under the guidance of NGOs, the single mothers thrive to become entrepreneurs so that they are able to take care of their children.

Government's active roles

The government of Tanzania has adopted multiple policies that advance gender equality and youth inclusion in a supportive enabling milieu. One of these is the recent victory against child marriage by making alteration in the marriage act that had been a real cause of celebration for country's boys and girls. Last year, the high court ruled the previous provisions unconstitutional and raised the minimum age of marriage to be 18 years. Still there are many things need to be done at the government level to ensure women are not deceived, exploited and spend their lives in poverty.

The rate of secondary school enrolment in Tanzania is as low as 31 percent, whereas girls' percentage is even lower. An estimated 5.1 million children aged 7 to 17 don't attend school. The percentage for girls enrolment is lower mainly due to physical transportation to and from school. World Bank's data shows less than one-third of all girls in the country are graduate. The government jointly needs to work with national and international bodies, NGOs, social workers etc. to promote empowerment of all women and girls and make secondary education mandatory for all girls. The duty of the government is to ensure that the country is able to achieve the United Nations-set Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5 – achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) by 2030.

COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR

Article content A regional state of emergency was declared on Thursday afternoon in response to COVID-19. In a press teleconference, it was announced the City of Cornwall, the United Counties of SDG, and the United Counties of Prescott-Russell were all making the declaration together, a unified front in the battle to prevent spreading of the virus. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR Back to video “We felt a regional approach to a declaration of emergency would be best,” Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement said. “It strengthens the (regional response), the importance of the message.” The message? Most have heard it but too many have not listened to it, mainly that those who are sick or are a returning traveller must isolate at home for 14 days. For those who are healthy, leaving the home should only occur when it’s an essential trip. And, people should keep two metres apart, buy only what they need at stores, wash their hands and help their neighbours. Speaking forcefully, Clement said “the time is now to flatten the curve,” and that community buy-in is “how we’re going to beat this thing. I’m calling on residents to do the right thing: stay home, stay connected, stay healthy.”

Article content Prescott-Russell Warden Pierre Leroux, in noting the measure gives municipal leaders extra powers during a crisis, said the redeployment of county resources such as personnel for emergency services was one example. Paramedic services is Prescott-Russell’s responsibility in that area, whereas the City of Cornwall administers the paramedic service within its borders and also within SDG. Leroux said the COVID-19 situation in the region “is still manageable,” but it is and will be more difficult because “we do have some ‘COVIDiots’ out there. . . we all need to get the message loud and clear.” Medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, started the teleconference by saying he’s been in close contact with municipal leaders for the last four to six weeks, and that now, that on March 26, “we felt it was a very important time to declare an emergency.” Why now? Because health experts, while acknowledging there are currently just four positive cases so far, expect the number to soon rise, and possibly quite dramatically. “We’re at the bottom of the curve, just starting to go up,” Roumeliotis said. Roumeliotis said that for the region overall, there are 300 tests still pending. He reiterated he believes there is community spread of the virus at this point, and that “our population is a vulnerable population,” because of demographics and a large number of elderly citizens, and a population with high incidence of chronic illnesses.

Article content More On This Topic Cornwall will push out funds to agencies ASAP EOHU to receive quarantine enforcement guidelines shortly Cornwall ready, and waiting, to declare a state of emergency SDG Warden Frank Prevost stressed the importance of following quarantine, self-isolation procedures, and that the declaration “gives us the opportunity to make decisions efficiently to protect the well-being of our residents.” In a question and answer session during the call, which was quite chaotic at times mainly because of ambient noise and some technical difficulties, Leroux said the declaration was both one that gives officials more power, but that it was also, and importantly, symbolic, in that “we want to make (the measures are) clear to all.” Clement expanded on earlier comments about the declaration, saying it “does give us more flexibility in how we direct resources to deal with the emergency. But the point of the regional approach is to send the strongest possible message to our residents that the time is now to slow down the spread of the virus.” The biggest concern for municipalities seems to be a flexibility to shuffle resources within their ranks. Clement explained the declaration allows staff members to be redeployed to wherever needs might be greatest moving forward, even for tasks that may not fall under that person’s collective agreement. Should the city’s own employees start to be impacted by COVID-19, that flexibility is needed to ensure the city can continue to operate. Roumeliotis was asked if a curfew could be invoked, limiting times during the day that people could be outside their homes. “It’s a last resort,” the doctor said, saying so far there’s been a “progressive approach” to having people stay at home, and that further limitations in the size of gatherings is what likely would come next. But, he said, all measures including a curfew are on the table, and that which course of action is taken “will depend completely on how the disease progresses and what toll it takes.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

Munro threw a message out on Facebook notifying owners and Bergeron reached out to the Cornwall and Area Chamber of Commerce herself so it could help spawn the idea quickly. “What happens on the business side is I take in all of the proceeds and pay it out once a week,” said Bergeron. “I’m very transparent.

Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

In particular, it outlines ways for governments to capture business action on the SDGs in their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

To better harness the participation of the private sector in SDG implementation, the report titled, ‘Using Corporate Reporting to Strengthen Sustainable Development Goals ,’ recommends that governments:

Involve the private sector in every step of SDGs implementation;

Facilitate and enforce effective SDGs disclosure by companies with best practice guidelines and regulations for mandatory reporting;

Align with existing, widely used corporate disclosure practices and frameworks, such as the GRI Standards;

Develop a measurement and monitoring tool to track private sector input, beginning with data made available through corporate sustainability reports, which is called for in SDG target 12.6; and

Enable regular dialogue between business, policy, and investors to encourage collaboration and reinforce their respective SDGs contributions.

The publication, which was released on 8 April 2020, aims to help countries prepare for the next round of VNRs during the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). According to the GRI authors, the VNR process provides “the perfect platform” for collaboration to increase impact. Capturing the contribution of the private sector is necessary for understanding what actions are needed and who can take them in order to achieve the SDG targets in each country.

Peter Paul van de Wijs, GRI, said it is “already clear that progress is too slow” on achieving the Goals, making partnerships and collaboration crucial. He encouraged policy makers to “do more to understand and make the most of the contribution from the private sector.”

The publication provides an overview of how VNRs to date have captured business contributions to the SDGs. In 2018, six countries included a specific section on the private sector: Ecuador, Greece, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, and Uruguay.

In 2019, GRI reports that:

Iceland recognized the key role of disclosing sustainability data and benchmarking companies, with a SDGs governmental working group engaged with the national center for corporate social responsibility to engage business on the SDGs;

Mongolia recognized the need to encourage sustainability reporting by companies based on global principles and good national practices;

Turkey conducted sectoral sustainability research covering reporting and SDG target 12.6, which concluded that more effort needs directed towards implementing corporate reporting practices; and

The Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued sustainability reporting guidelines for listed companies, which provides a framework for reporting on corporate contributions to the SDGs.

The report also shares examples of how countries are advancing SDG target 12.6: “Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.” Most countries do not share data on their efforts to fulfill this target, GRI report. In 2019, only nine countries provided such an update.

The authors stress that by increased business reporting on sustainability impacts would provide policy actors with valuable data to improve the assessment and implementation of the SDGs in their countries, and it would enable a government to engage with businesses on their contributions to the SDGs.","The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has published recommendations on strengthening national-level progress on the SDGs with the use of corporate reporting.

The publication also highlights linkages with specific SDG targets and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) on chemicals.

The brochure titled, ‘Benefits from Implementing a Chemical Management System,’ focuses on benefits related to: the management of industrial chemicals; agricultural pesticides; chemical accidents prevention, preparedness and response; and the establishment of the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs).

The brochure describes the ways in which sound chemicals management contributes to achieving specific SDG targets, namely:

Target 3.9 on reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination;

Target 6.3 on improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials;

Target 9.4 on making infrastructure and industries sustainable;

Target 11.6 on reducing cities’ environmental impacts; and

Target 12.4 on achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes.

In addition, the brochure points to progress and challenges related to the tracking of SDGs with PRTRs. It mentions that the OECD is exploring how PRTR data can be used to undertake analyses, and evaluate and potentially accelerate progress towards meeting relevant SDG targets.



Sound chemicals management also helps implement various chemicals-related MEAs, which were adopted between 1985 and 2013, including: the Minamata Convention on Mercury; the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs); the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC); the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer; and the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.

Sound management also helps implement the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), which was established in 2006, and is currently under negotiation for the period beyond 2020.

The guidebook provides practical “how-to” guidance for SAIs in auditing their respective countries’ SDG implementation. The IDI SDGs Audit Model (ISAM) adheres to five principles: focus on outcomes; recognize SAI diversity; base the guidance on International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs); inclusiveness; and add value.

For the purposes of the SDGs Audit Model, an audit of SDG implementation is defined as a “performance audit that focuses on the achievement of nationally-agreed targets linked to the SDG targets.” It does not focus on entities, projects, programs, or processes. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between the entities, projects, programs, and processes for the achievement of cross-cutting results. The audit methodology presented in the guidebook focuses on the achievement of outcomes while also encouraging audit institutions to mainstream actions for enhancing impact throughout the audit process.

The guidebook includes chapters on how to select topics for audits, how to design an audit of SDG implementation, how to draft a report that has an impact, and how to follow up on the audit. It also includes sections addressing how to audit a government’s efforts related to coherence and integration, multi-stakeholder engagement, efforts to ensure no one is left behind, and policies related to the achievement of a national target.

The ISAM encourages SAIs to focus on the “leave no one behind” principle underlying the 2030 Agenda as a key consideration in defining audits of SDG implementation and throughout the audit process.

The English version of the ISAM was launched on 31 March 2020. It is currently available in English and Spanish. It will be translated into Arabic and French prior to June 2020. The ISAM will be updated based on lessons learned during pilot audits and other feedback.

The brief, which was released in April 2020, explains that, while SAICM has m­­­ade significant progress regarding strengthening capacity, commitment, technical knowledge, and political will to implement and mainstream chemicals into national planning, its objectives and 2020 goal to minimize the adverse impacts of chemicals and waste will not be achieved.

More ambitious action is needed, and the brief describes progress made and considerations in moving beyond 2020 related to:

reducing the widening gap between countries;

inspiring political will to act at national levels;

sharing knowledge and information;

securing stable finances and resources;

strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure;

improving the monitoring framework to assess progress; and

addressing emerging policy issues (EPIs).

On reducing inequality between developed and developing countries and addressing human rights issues, the brief emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable and marginalized groups from chemicals exposure at work, in the home and in the environment, including through the provision of technical infrastructure, such as poison centers, and strengthened collaboration between actors in chemicals management and human rights focusing on gendered impacts of exposure and childhood exposure.



Regarding inspiring political will, considerations in moving beyond 2020 include, among others: building National Focal Point (NFP) capacity so they can fulfill mandates and encourage stakeholder buy-in and mobilization of resources; increasing ownership of SAICM to encourage implementation of the integrated approach to financing; and improving representation of health, agriculture, finance, and other relevant sectors to support national efforts to mainstream SAICM across departments.



Regarding sharing knowledge and information, the brief mentions: establishing a global system to share and fill information gaps on hazardous chemicals and waste; and creating a scientific forum with the potential to develop internationally agreed methodologies for risk and hazard assessment.



On securing stable finances and resources, the policy brief underlines the need to: mainstream SAICM’s strategic objectives into national development plans and budgets; and utilize economic instruments, such as the ‘polluter pays principle,’ to address externalities resulting from chemicals production, use and disposal.



On strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure, recommendations include enhancing linkages and collaboration between sectors to support efforts to mainstream SAICM across government departments and create linkages to each country-level UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.



The document also discusses improving the monitoring framework to assess progress by strengthening linkages to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic and Time-bound) indicators to complement or replace existing indicators.

On emerging policy issues (EPIs), recommendations include recognizing ‘highly hazardous pesticides’ as an EPI, and agreeing on the most suitable testing regime for endocrine disrupting chemicals.

Participants called for accelerating the region’s progress to support the Decade of Action and Delivery.

Over 300 stakeholders participated in the virtual meeting, which convened on 19 March. UNECE originally planned to hold a one- and a half day Forum with 15 sessions and a focus on peer learning. In response to the COVID-10 pandemic, UNECE changed the conference to an entirely virtual meeting. Special webinars focused on solutions to challenges in delivering on the SDGs and the importance of gender-responsive standards, policy coherence and reliable statistics. A virtual Civil Society Meeting, which coordinated the inputs of over 150 civil society partners across the region, preceded the Forum.

In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed said “we have not yet seen the broad and deep transformative change that the 2030 Agenda requires.” She stressed, “there is no denying that we have a mountain to climb over the coming decade” and emphasized a sense of urgency for all regional fora for the SDGs.

UNECE presented the findings of a first regional report on SDG progress, which finds “some good progress and many gaps” on the way to transformative change in the UNECE region. The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators and finds increased ambition is needed to meet environmental targets. The Forum also discussed how Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) contribute to realizing the SDGs in the region.

Countries shared concrete actions to accelerate SDG progress and advance green and inclusive change, such as the UNECE Trees in the Cities Challenge. European Commission (EC) representative, Luca Marmo, presented the European Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan. Finland shared its strategy to become carbon neutral by 2035, and Denmark highlighted its Youth Climate Advisory Council as a channel for youth engagement in Denmark.

Alongside calls for accelerating SDG efforts, participants recognized the need for solidarity and multilateralism, given the COVID-19 pandemic. The vice president of the European Youth Council, Tina Hočevar, said “we can beat this crisis and we can beat the climate crisis” with rationality and solidarity.

Since its launch in March 2018, approximately 686 tonnes of waste have been shipped from eligible Pacific islands and territories for treatment and recycling in suitable ports in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Partnership between SPREP and the China Navigation Company (CNCo), also known as SWIRE Shipping, allows for CNCo vessels to carry, free of charge, containers of recyclable waste from eligible ports in Pacific island countries and territories that have insufficient or inappropriate landfill space to store waste, have inadequate waste treatment facilities, and lack financial capacity to ship recyclable waste.

Kosi Latu, Director General of SPREP, has described the Moana Taka Partnership as a “paddle in the right direction” towards tackling the “immense waste management challenge” in Pacific islands.

The focus of the Partnership is on non-commercial waste streams and the types of materials that are considered recyclable, including plastics, aluminum cans, waste oil, and ozone depleting substances. Twenty-one Pacific island countries and territories are eligible to participate in the scheme.

Examples of shipments of recyclable waste made thus far include: six containers of scrap metal from Samoa and Papua New Guinea; nine containers of plastic waste from Fiji; three containers of used oil from the Marshall Islands; and 16 containers of varied waste contents from Fiji.

The Partnership contributes to implementation of the Pacific Regional Waste and Pollution Management Strategy 2016-2015, ‘Cleaner Pacific 2025,’ a “comprehensive long-term strategy for integrated sustainable waste management and pollution prevention and control in the Pacific islands region until 2025.” Priority areas for management outlined in the Strategy include municipal solid waste, asbestos, electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), healthcare waste, chemicals (such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ozone depleting substances, and mercury), used oil and lubricants, marine litter, ship-sourced pollution, disaster waste, and liquid waste (such as sewage and trade waste).

As such, the initiative forms an important contribution towards achieving SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols.

There's a little more padding as well, but it's still fairly firm and supportive enough for the long days of EWS racing (remember racing?).



The SM Enduro isn't as shockingly light as some in this list, but the prices are a lot less stratospheric, too. A saddle is a wear item on an enduro bike, so maybe not spending a week's salary on one is a good idea. And to that end, it's got tough-feeling material around the back and sides of the saddle as well.



The flat portions of the rails are longer than others to help nail your seat position. This is a super nice detail for taller riders who often end up with slack effective seat-tube angles once their saddle height is correct. More adjustability is a big help for them.

Life is difficult right now – there’s no way to sugar coat it! We’re modifying our behaviours, adjusting our routines and giving up time with our loved ones. The pay off should be worth it, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard.

In difficult times, hearing heartwarming stories can provide us with an extra boost of positivity. Everyone is looking for ways to stay positive and to help make things just a little easier for their loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, etc. I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

There have been a lot of stories of individuals and organizations using their 3D printers to provide protective equipment to healthcare workers – within days of closing, Library staff were involved in testing these types of printing projects for Glengarry Memorial Hospital.

Since that first week, staff have been working to print face shields and most recently, mask straps. The face shields are still in progress, as the print jobs originally took nine hours and finding the clear plastic is difficult to source. The library has arranged to have their shields available to GMH staff as a back up should they run out of their supply of protective equipment. Thankfully, there has been no need for that yet.

The mask straps, designed to relieve the pressure on the ears from wearing a face mask for extended periods of time, were delivered to extremely grateful hospital staff last week.

We’re proud that we are able to use our equipment to provide support to our brave healthcare workers. Printing these items has been a real team effort, involving numerous staff to make it happen. Library staff continue to demonstrate that we are a resourceful bunch – and we’re ready to respond to any needs we can during this difficult time.","I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

“Our first goal is to keep more ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve,” said Lister. “The loose prediction is that we will need seven new ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve.”

He explained that this would bring the total number of ambulances on the road in the region to 14, though he added he would be more comfortable with 17.

That being said, Lister also explained that overall, his service was seeing a lower call volume than is typical for this time of year. He said that for the past week, his service was receiving around 40 calls a day, and that normal levels were around 50.

Lister credited the cancellation of elective surgeries by hospitals, and the provincial and local orders to self-isolate, keeping people at home and out of danger.

On Friday, April 3, in a teleconference with local media, Chief Lister said that his service was expecting and preparing for a spike in call volumes related to COVID-19.

“We are expecting call volume to climb dramatically in the next few weeks and months,” said Lister. “We are preparing to meet that demand, but we need the support, understanding, and patience of residents.”

In addition to adding more ambulances to the road, Lister said that he also planned on hiring another 12 to 20 part-time paramedics to supplement the 66 full-time and 54 part-time paramedics already on staff.","CORNWALL, Ontario – Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services Chief Bill Lister told Cornwall City Council during a Special Meeting on Tuesday, April 7 that his goal was to get seven more ambulances on the road to deal with any future spike in COVID-19 cases in the region.

Article content Hospitals in SDG and Prescott-Russell have about a week to a 10 days’ worth of personal protective equipment before they run out. Eastern Ontario Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis confirmed this Monday, saying unless the region received a massive supply of equipment within the next few days, local hospitals could be forced to decontaminate masks and reuse them. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG/Prescott-Russell to run out of PPE within 10 days: EOHU Back to video “We’re also being told that any day now we should be receiving a massive supply, so were crossing our fingers,” Roumeliotis said during Monday’s teleconference briefing. “At this point it’s either we decontaminate it and reuse it, or we get a big supply.” According to Roumeliotis, directives to decontaminate and reuse the equipment stemmed from both federal and provincial governments. “Medical-grade facemasks should be reserved only for healthcare providers,” he said. “Healthcare providers use those to protect themselves and to protect their patients.”

Roumeliotis still could not give an exact number when asked how many ventilators were in the Prescott-Russell and SDG area, citing that he did not have enough time to look it up. “I don’t have those numbers,” he said. “I’ve just had so many things to do.” Fifth centre opens

Five testing centres are now up and running in the EOHU area — Casselman, Hawkesbury, Winchester, Cornwall and Rockland, which opened its doors on Monday. Roumeliotis outlined there was the potential to open one in Alexandria, if needed. In total, the SDG and Prescott-Russell areas have 44 confirmed cases, with three of them currently in intensive care unit (ICU) and two in a non-ICU setting. Of the five hospitalized cases for the area, three are housed in the Cornwall Community Hospital — with two of them being in ICU. “They are all in stable condition,” answered Roumeliotis when asked about them. “There were rumours that there was a death due to the virus in the area. At this point, we haven’t had any reports of death related to COVID. So far, we haven’t had any deaths.” More On This Topic Eastern Ontario Health Unit now at 42 local cases of COVID-19 EOHU now at 34 cases, including first youth Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Data unveiled by the province on Monday outlined that of the 44 local cases, three have now been classified as resolved. Of those who tested positive, 22 are women and 24 are men. Only one case is reported as being under the age of 20. Three are in the 20s, eight in their 30s, four are in their 40s, 14 are in their 50s, 13 are in their 60s and two are in their 70s. One person’s age is labelled by the province as unknown.

Roumeliotis expressed once again that residents should not visit family members during the pandemic — especially during the upcoming Easter weekend. “Again, I urge everybody, please don’t get together with your families,” he said. “I know that for many it’s an important religious holiday, but it’s really important, particularly over the next week or two, that we stay at home, that we don’t gather and that we don’t go see grandma. “It’s well worth doing phone calls or getting together virtually to protect the most vulnerable in our community.” He also said the number of confirmed cases seems to have slowed down recently. “There’s a bit of a peak between March 14 and March 26,” said Roumeliotis. “We had about five to six new cases on a daily basis. Now it has sort of gone down. We’re looking at keeping that low and we’re going to be monitoring very closely.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine Resources: Ontario’s COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool

North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban. . . we recognize that many (residents) are eager to resume burning for both agricultural and recreational purposes.”

Meanwhile, in South Stormont, Fire Chief Gilles Crepeau partially lifted the total burn ban for agriculturally-zoned properties only, effective 12 p.m. Friday, in an effort to allow farmers to prepare for the upcoming planting season.

Effective Thursday, the one in North Glengarry, which had been put in place April 3, was lifted.

Total burn bans, implemented to prevent unneeded firefighting calls in the age of COVID-19, are slowly starting to lift.

“We need your help to keep our community safe,” he said.

All open air burns must be monitored at all times, and burning noxious materials – including plastics, tires, garbage and construction materials – is not permitted.

In South Stormont, where there’s a partial lifting of the burn ban, all agriculturally-zoned permit holders must contact Crepeau at 613-534-8889 ext. 250, or at gilles@southstormont.ca, for authorization prior to any burns. Those planning agricultural burns that do not have a permit can download the application and drop the application off at the dropbox outside the main entrance of town hall in Long Sault, along with a cheque for the $10 permit fee.

Those applying for a new permit must also contact the chief for authorization to burn prior to any burning. Each property requires its own permit, and must follow the bylaw.

Crepeau said the township burn ban for recreational fires and open-air burning on properties not zoned agricultural remains in place and will be reviewed on a week-to-week basis. Should any restrictions be lifted or reduced, an announcement will be made.

“I want to do it in stages,” Crepeau told the Standard-Freeholder on Friday. “I know people are getting anxious. I respect that everyone the last six or seven weeks has accumulated (a lot of burn items), and people want to have something to do – they want to have a bonfire.

“I think any week now, we’ll (have a full) lift.”

But, the chief said, it’s been a dry season, and with a high risk of grassfires, at this time, this year, only a partial lift makes sense. A lot of the decision will be weather-based, he said, but in the meantime, prior to a full lift, and because offices and processing times are different, it’s a good idea to submit applications now, or soon, so that “when (the ban is) lifted you’ll already have your permit,” Crepeau suggested.

Outside of those two townships, it’s best to check with your local municipality on whether any outdoor burns are permitted— including the City of Cornwall, where there is no open-air burn bylaw in place, so provincial regulations apply.","North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban.

Article content Residents are urged only to call emergency medical services in case of a catastrophe, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services are preparing for an increase in call volume as the virus spreads. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Back to video “Efforts have been underway to ‘flatten the curve’, so that not everybody needs help at the same time,” said paramedic Chief Bill Lister. “We haven’t eliminated the curve, we’ve flatten it, but call volumes are anticipated to increase over the next few weeks and months. “As well as recognize that we’ll have an unusual call volume, and be patient as it may take us a little longer to get to the door steps than they’re traditionally used to.” They currently receive about 49 calls per day for cases around the region, but Lister expects that number to climb up to 60 once the pandemic reaches its peak. Lister insists people should only call 911 if they are experiencing a heart attack, stroke, become unconscious, or have severe, unexplained shortness of breath.

Article content “We’re looking for the calls that are unusual; if your shortness of breath feels like you’ve run a marathon, just getting off the couch,” said Lister. “Those are calls that should be called to 911. If you’re just unwell because of the flu, those are ones that you should probably stay at home; 80 per cent of the population will recover without the need for any kind of intervention.” He said people should contact the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, Telehealth and use self-assessment tools online to determine if they do indeed need emergency assistance, if they feel like they have COVID-19 symptoms. Those who need to go to the hospital, require a medical appointment or need to go to an assessment centre should call a friend, take a taxi or use public transit if they can get there without the need of an ambulance. This would relieve the need of tying up lines for those who actually need assistance. “We’re trying to save the resources for the sickest people and everybody who can participate in that would help us,” said Lister. “We’ve been anticipating this climb and the health units have been very proactive in advising of what the epidemiology of this would be.” The unit currently has 66 full-time and 54 part-time paramedics. They plan to hire 12 to 20 more employees due to the pandemic. More On This Topic Three City of Cornwall departments hit with provincial funding changes New safety features added to Cornwall-SDG ambulances “There’s been a bit of a problem with the colleges closed before paramedic students could graduate,” said Lister. “We’re working around that. It’s not much of an issue right, but the hiring process takes a couple of weeks and we’re hoping to have that up and running very shortly.”

Article content Paramedics follow a strict point of care risk assessment process to protect themselves of any exposure to the virus when treating a patient. “The first is a screening tool that the dispatcher system uses,” said Lister. “If they display or complain of any kind of flu like symptoms, the dispatchers will alert the medic that these people might have an infectious situation going on and they should take precautions.” Paramedics will conduct an assessment two metres away from the patient, because the belief is COVID is droplet-spread, which means it is spread through coughing or mucous-membrane contact. The paramedics do wear gloves and gowns. They’ll wear a face shield and goggles and a mask. The unit also has an infectious disease process to ensure equipment is clean and free of immunological conditions. “It’s in place all the time, not just in COVID,” said Lister. “It’s heightened now. We’re doing more environmental cleaning that carries on. Most of the equipment is disposable, where we throw it out after a one-time use. The equipment that isn’t, like the stretchers, we clean them between each patient contact. We have use a hydrogen peroxide base cleaner that’s been recommended for any type of virus or bacteria. “We’re quite comfortable and confident that once the cleaning process has been done, the place is safe for the next patient.” Elective surgeries such as routine mammograms have been cancelled to free up room space in anticipation of what’s to come. Lister said the growth rate is difficult to determine at this time. There are currently 14 ambulances in the fleet, with three as spares that are used for mechanical issues such as maintenance or repairs. The goal is to have 14 on the road during the peak height of the pandemic. If for any reason one of the Cornwall-SDG ambulances wasn’t available, provincial dispatch protocols would send the next-closest available ambulance, even if it had to come from outside of SDG. jsantos@Postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

The simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

At least as far as where that activity can occur.

A lot of public spaces and walking trails are closed, but there are still opportunities in the region for people to get out and stretch their legs.

The Raisin Region Conservation Authority, as part of its response to COVID-19, closed the Gray’s Creek Marina, including access to docks and the boat launch until further notice, but the public can still enjoy its network of nature trails, at the conservation area and also at the Cooper Marsh Conservation Area and Charlottenburgh Park.

The RRCA is continuing to require visitors to practise physical distancing, avoid gathering in groups, and refrain from touching common surfaces.

A number of activities, of course, had to be cancelled, including the popular annual Raisin River Canoe Race the RRCA organizes.

But, some services have continued, including the spring seedling sale. The RRCA before Easter weekend noted there were still a limited number of white pine and white spruce seedlings available for order, and those who purchased tree seedlings will be contacted soon, with information on the pickup date, along with the precautionary measures in place to ensure staff and customer safety.","Walking trails accessible over much of the Cornwall/SDG regionArticle contentThe simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

For the pilot accelerator, it has selected 11 startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

The program, which has been moved online for the time due to the pandemic, which run for 5 months, beginning from April 21.

Due to the current corona crisis all physical elements (e.g. workshops, events) of the program have been transformed into a virtual version in order to support both the startups and the people behind them. All 11 finalists will now have access to a five-months accelerator program provided by Google for Startups. Google

Out of the 11 startups selected, mDoc, a Nigerian healthcare startup that uses technology to make health services more accessible to people is one.

Here is what mDoc does

mDoc provides 24 hours support to people in sub-Saharan Africa with chronic diseases. It does this by connecting people through a virtual network to healthcare service providers using its app.

Through its tech platform, mDoc has a secured centralized repository of users’ healthcare information and uses it to connect them to various practitioners such as nutritionists and coaches.

The experts, in turn, help users with their health goals. They also help people find quality in-person healthcare when needed.

mDoc’s geo-coded database of healthcare providers makes it easy for users to access quality health care from different parts of Africa using their health information which can be updated and monitored on mDoc’s app.

Why was mDoc selected?

Besides its laudable operations and using tech to deliver quality services, the health startup was selected because its services align with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined by the United Nations.

By tackling the problem of access to quality healthcare and support for people with chronic disease, mDoc is working to realize SDG number 3 in Africa.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3

As a part of the accelerator, mDoc will work with Google engineers. The startup will equally have access to mentoring from over 20 teams at Google, as well as outside experts and local mentors.

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

81,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/countries-preparing-for-unea-5-stockholm50/,"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Countries Preparing for UNEA-5, Stockholm+50","The UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Committee of Permanent Representatives held a virtual meeting to “continue the business of environmental governance.” The Committee discussed plans for the fifth UNEA session, which is scheduled to take place in February 2021. They also agreed on UNEA’s input to the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and considered the way forward on the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, in 2022.

At the 150th meeting of the CPR on 30 April 2020, the UNEP Secretariat updated the CPR on preparations for UNEA-5. The session will have the theme, ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ It is expected to convene in Nairobi, Kenya, from 22-26 February 2021.

The Secretariat described the session’s expected strategic and thematic elements, which include:

Agreement by the multilateral community on four areas for transformative action for nature to achieve the SDGs: Action area 1: Nature for Jobs and Economic Prosperity Action area 2: Nature for Health Action area 3: Nature for Climate Action area 4: Nature for Sustainable Food Systems

The importance of communication to citizens, and plans for the ‘Actions #ForNature’ campaign that blends the World Environment Day ‘Time #ForNature’ campaign with the UNEA theme; and

The relevance of the UNEA-5 theme in the era of COVID-19, in light of the need for urgent, transformative, and sustained actions to “deliberately reshape humanity’s interaction with nature,” including by re-building economies in ways that address systemic threats to nature (e.g. unsustainable consumption and production, rapid urbanization, weaknesses in governance and accountability).

Committee members pointed to UNEA-5 as an opportunity to provide global political leadership towards a sustainable recovery post COVID-19 and to other global sustainable development processes, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such as by centering COVID-19 recovery plans around investments in nature and green jobs, sustainable finance, sound chemicals management, and sustainable production and consumption.

Ahead of the July 2020 session of the HLPF, the CPR agreed to submit the UNEA input developed through remote negotiations and silence procedure. The input to HLPF reports that: “January 2020 was the hottest month of January ever recorded, one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years and air pollution kills millions of people every year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that the world is currently facing, and its immediate aftermath, are likely to place additional strains on the environment.” Moreover, “the climate, biodiversity and chemicals crises have not disappeared [and] the world can ill-afford delays in key environment-related decision-making and investment.”

The UNEA recommends that the 2020 HLPF, among other items:

call for ambition in the 2020 environmental negotiations whose success will be crucial for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda including the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the international sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020;

stress that COVID-19 does not provide a “silver lining” for the environment but offers an opportunity for rebuilding the world better through green and sustainable recovery efforts, sound management of hazardous medical, and chemical waste and a clear commitment to “building back better”;

recognize the role of regional level coordination as key to address transboundary issues and facilitate regionally coherent approaches; and

acknowledge the request made to the UNEP Executive Director to develop a global environmental data strategy by 2025 and ask other UN entities to contribute to the strategy.

On commemorating the 50th anniversary of UNEP, in 2022, the Committee discussed Sweden’s offer to host a high-level political meeting in Stockholm to commemorate the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment. The CPR asked the UNEA secretariat to prepare a report on substantive aspects of preparations for the 50th anniversary.

In his statement to the 150th meeting, CPR Chair Fernando Coimbra (Brazil) said “the environmental agenda remains one of our most powerful insurance policies in preventing future global pandemics like COVID-19.” He added, “we have learnt the hard way that environmental protection is not a luxury,” but essential for growth and protection of vulnerable populations.

He highlighted that the COVID-19 medical emergency is resulting in a rapid increase in medical and hazardous waste. The UNEP framework ‘Towards a Pollution-Free Planet’ agreed at UNEA-4 provides support for Member States to address capacity gaps in medical waste systems in order to minimize possible secondary impacts on health and the environment.

The Chair also recalled that a “prescient” UNEP report from 2016 found that 60% of all known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. In other words, COVID-19 is just one of many diseases now known to have crossed between animals and humans. Currently, he said, UNEP is mapping the links between deteriorating ecosystem health, habitat and biodiversity loss, and over-exploitation of species. This will allow for policies to interrupt the zoonotic transmission pathways and provide “safe operating space” for nature, to prevent future pandemics.

Coimbra stressed that an ambitious, measurable and inclusive Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as The Beyond 2020 Chemicals and Waste Management Framework, because both play a central role in keeping nature intact, diverse and flourishing. Finally, he said the postponement of the next UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) is as an opportunity to strengthen NDCs by incorporating recovery efforts and climate-friendly investments to stimulate economies, build resilience, and create green and sustainable job opportunities.

The lessons are presented in a paper titled, ‘Accountability in a Time of Crisis’ released in April 2020.

The paper was developed by the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI), Audit Service Sierra Leone (ASSL), General Auditing Commission of Liberia (GAC), and African Organisation of French-speaking Supreme Audit Institutions (CREFIAF).

Emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed.

The introduction to the paper notes that “emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed, combined with weakening of accountability systems and oversight.” The rush to address a crisis may result in increased levels of waste, mismanagement, and corruption, they caution.

The paper draws from audits of previous crises, including the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, to identify lessons that can be used for handling the coronavirus crisis. The paper presents recommendations for the role that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) could play in the crisis and safeguards that development partners could apply when funding COVID-19 measures.

Among the activities that SAIs can provide during a pandemic are:

provide advice on rules and regulations;

conduct real-time audits on procurement;

audit the implementation of new regulations and programmes;

maintain dialogue with stakeholders such as the government, development partners, and CSOs to understand the COVID-19 response, the main risks, and how the SAI can add value through its audit work; and

undertake short, special audit reports in order to issue timely and relevant reports outside the normal audit cycle.

In the aftermath of a crisis, the paper recommends that SAI audits be used for accountability purposes as well as to identify lessons for the future.

The paper also suggests that development partners can reinforce good governance practices and carefully select short-term safeguards while encouraging the adoption of medium-term safeguards. Recommendations for how development partners can achieve these objectives include:

produce immediate messaging to strengthen and reinforce behaviors:

encourage key national stakeholders and other implementing agencies to send clear messages setting expectations about the use of and accountability for emergency funds;

in the short-term, use appropriate safeguards relevant for different sector risks and funding modalities; and

in the medium-term, encourage governments to take action on relevant prior audit reports, bringing key findings and recommendations into policy dialogue, and encourage SAIs to stay visible and conduct follow-up audits on implementation of prior recommendations.

The paper recommends that development partners should ensure that SAIs can audit the use of emergency funds. The authors suggest that development partners should consider how funds will be audited at the outset rather than after funds have been spent.

The number of people suffering hunger has increased, climate change is occurring faster than predicted, and inequality is increasing within and among countries, António Guterres says in his ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ 2020 report.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched four years ago to address the most pressing global needs for a sustainable future, including education and health improvements and reductions in social and economic inequalities.

“I think [food price rises are] probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before. It’s like having an emergency in every single country.” Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy, WFP

“The effects of the pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact have overwhelmed the health systems globally, caused businesses and factories to shut down and severely impacted the livelihoods of half of the global workforce,” he says in the report.

It comes on top of an existing slowing in progress towards many of the SDGs, and Guterres had launched a Decade of Action in September to turn things around.

The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The report has been released ahead of UN Economic and Social Council high-level meetings scheduled for July to provide a global, data-driven overview of the SDGs.

Women and girls

Last year’s report had already warned that there was “simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls”.

In the 2020 review, Guterres says “the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled”.

Only half of the world’s women who are married or ‘in-union’ make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, based on 2007-2018 data from 57 countries, the report says.

Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.

More than 260 million children were out of school in 2017 and 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in 2018.

As of 2019, less than half of primary and lower secondary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, computers, the internet and basic handwashing facilities, the report states.

Billions of people worldwide still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, including 2.2 billion people without safe drinking water.

And, the world is projected to miss the target to end poverty in all its forms as hunger increased for the fourth consecutive year and about 50 million children experienced acute undernutrition. Globally, 144 million children under five were still affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters of these children in Central and Southern Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.

Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

“The SDGs reflected the political will of the time,” she says. “Today, in the midst of this pandemic, I think it’s safe to say global political will is in short supply.”

Food crisis

Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in institutions and development at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), says he is sceptical of suggestions in the report that progress has been made on poverty, because the quality of data from national governments has become worse.

He says that wage protections and labour rights need to be made into political issues to ensure they stay on governments’ radars.

“COVID-19 is going to make questions of hunger much worse,” Sinha says. “People are talking about a global response in terms of a vaccine, I think we should pay attention to those who are talking about a global response to the coming food crisis.”

The SDG progress report comes after the United Nations predicted last week that the COVID-19 crisis could push 130 million more people into poverty in the next 10 years.

About 35 million people are expected to fall below the extreme poverty line this year as a result of the pandemic, with 56 per cent of them in Africa, the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2020 report predicted.

The global economy is forecast to lose a staggering US$8.5 trillion in production over the next two years due to the pandemic, the UN report says.

This is a “tremendous setback” for sustainable development, Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, told SciDev.Net.

“[The pandemic] is particularly affecting the more vulnerable groups … because these are the ones whose activities generally require some form of physical proximity to others.”

Remittances

Remittances from migrant workers in the global North could face a hit – in countries such as Haiti, South Sudan and Tonga, remittances constitute more than a third of gross domestic product.

“You have an abrupt cut of people’s livelihoods and incomes, and then you’ve got different kinds of cascading effects through the bigger food system,” says Sophia Murphy, senior specialist in agriculture, trade and investment at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

There are also fears about what the pandemic could mean for long-term food security, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) estimating that 130 million more people in low- and middle-income countries may be pushed into acute food insecurity this year.

Bumper crops in some regions are at risk of being wasted. India has been hit by COVID-19 at harvest time, with crops left unpicked and difficulties getting grain to market for sale before it spoils.

This comes after rising hunger in the three years to 2018 pushed undernourishment back to levels seen around 2010.

Evidence of price rises has already emerged. In Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo, the WFP notes a 10 per cent surge in the price of a typical local basket of food – comprising fish, pulses, peanut paste, cassava flour, oil and condiments – in the space of two weeks.

The organisation expects food price rises to occur more widely, as this is happening in countries such as Syria, where prices have more than doubled in the past year.

“I think it’s probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before,” says Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy at the WFP’s London office.

“It’s like having an emergency in every single country that you’re working in.”

Some countries are already reeling from other problems, such as the locust swarms in East Africa, leading to potentially “devastating” impacts, she adds.","The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The plan aims to reduce the EU’s consumption footprint, double its circular material use rate, and contribute to economic decarbonization by reducing the EU’s carbon and material footprint.

The Circular Economy Action Plan for a Cleaner and More Competitive Europe, which is central to the European Green Deal, seeks to ensure that the economy is fit for a green future and strengthen competitiveness while protecting the environment. It introduces legislative and non-legislative measures and target areas where action at the EU level brings added value.

More specifically, the Circular Economy Action Plan details measures to:

make sustainable products the norm in the EU, including, for example, the restriction of single-use products and ensuring that products on the EU market are designed to last longer, are easier to reuse, repair, and recycle, and incorporate recycled material as much as possible;

empower consumers through access to reliable information about products at the point of sale, including on their life span;

focus on sectors that use the most resources and have the potential for high circularity, including electronics and information and communications technology (ICT), batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, and food; and

ensure less waste by transforming it into high-quality secondary resources and implementing actions to minimize EU waste exports and tackle illegal shipments.

Applying ambitious circular economy measures in Europe can increase the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) by an additional 0.5% by 2030, creating around 700,000 new jobs, according to a European Commission press release.

The Action Plan includes measures to mobilize private financing in support of the circular economy through EU financial instruments, such as InvestEU. It also proposes the launch of a global circular economy alliance to explore starting a discussion on a possible international agreement on natural resource management.

The dialogues gather UN Member States, civil society, and UN representatives for off-the-record discussions, in parallel to the ongoing intergovernmental consultations on the declaration.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the declaration – Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden – issued an “elements paper” on 9 April. The paper proposes the declaration contain three sections: Acknowledging achievements and looking ahead; Delivering on commitments and responding to global challenges; and Building consensus and mobilizing for change.

In 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature.

The first dialogue in the series took place on 23 April with a focus on ‘Acknowledging Achievements and looking ahead,’ the first section of the elements paper. According to the discussion summary, this dialogue gathered 157 representatives from 19 UN Member States and over 100 civil society organizations. The discussion highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic represents the clearest example of several, intersecting global crises. It points to the need to strengthen multilateralism and address mistrust.

Participants noted that in 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature. It was emphasized that inclusion is “not solely for representation,” since one group’s advancement should lead to the advancement of all. Similarly, national sovereignty itself should be re-evaluated. No country is autonomous in this interdependent world, participants emphasized, and addressing problems globally is in the best interest of all.

Building on this idea, the declaration should propose that the UN no longer function to find equilibrium among competing national interests, but strive to replace an intergovernmental approach with a supranational one. Other proposals included:

Establish a post-2020 process to consider and implement recommendations for reform.

Re-evaluate process for reaching consensus, to ensure a “recalcitrant few” cannot hold back a vast majority.

Consider possible formats for a UN Parliamentary Assembly.

The second dialogue, on 30 April, took up the declaration’s possible section on ‘Delivering on Commitments and Responding to Global Challenges,’ which is expected to contain the most substantive, practical proposals, and serve as the primary vehicle to lay out a plan for the future of the UN. The third dialogue in the series will convene on 7 May, to address ‘Building consensus and mobilizing for change.’ This section is meant to serve as the call to service for the governments of the world.

86,https://expertinvestoreurope.com/what-do-bad-sdg-impact-ratings-mean/,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Expert Investor,What do ‘bad’ SDG impact ratings mean?,"“It’s just a realistic status of where we are,” says Till Jung, managing director, global head of ESG products at ISS, when commenting on the low positive impact companies have on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services, recently rated a universe of more than 6,500 companies and revealed that only 3% of these delivered a significant positive impact on the SDGs.

The firm applies a holistic view in its rating and measures a company’s overall contribution to the SDGs. This is a company’s most distinct and material, positive and negative performance across its products and services, operations and controversies, which it then aggregates, explains Jung.

The tool seeks to help investors align their portfolios to the SDGs and report on them.

SDG leaders and laggards

A champion would stand out through “positive contributions to those SDGs on which, given its business model, it can have the greatest potential for positive impact, and at the same time have no negative impacts in the remaining SDGs”.

But while many would expect Tesla to score positively, the tool did not evaluate the firm as expected, Jung tells Expert Investor.

It has a significant positive impact on SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy; and SDG 13 – climate action, as it derives a large percentage of revenue from, for example, solar energy systems, electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, Jung explains.

However, it is also one of the lowest performing companies on SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth.

Tesla underperforms in the management of labour issues in the supply chain, as well as employee health and safety standards and failed to respect union rights in the US, ISS ESG’s analysis has shown.

“Tesla’s positive contribution to SDGs 7 and 13 is therefore netted out by its significant negative impact on SDG 8,” explains Jung.

Among the strongest overall performers rated with the tool is a French real estate company, Klépierre – which contributes to SDG 11 – sustainable cities and communities.

Approximately 99% of the firm’s standing assets by value have been certified with the green building standard BREEAM and the firm also manages potential negative externalities across the remaining SDGs, says Jung.

SDGs as investing tool

The importance of SDG investing is rising, according to Rachel Bass, senior manager, research at non-profit organisation Global Impact Investing Network (Giin).

“We are seeing more and more impact investors aligning their portfolios with the SDGs, with nearly three-quarters of respondents to the Giin’s 2020 State of Impact Measurement and Management Practice survey using the SDGs to guide their impact measurement and management practices, and over half setting their impact targets to the SDGs,” she tells Expert Investor.

The application of the SDGs in investments, however, is an evolving process.

Bass explains that the development goals “provide a useful framework for understanding impact in a broader global context, but they were originally drafted with governments as the intended audience, not investors”.

Piet Klop, senior advisor responsible investment at Dutch asset manager PGGM, adds: “We consider the SDGs as a useful lingua franca; they help to align our investments with overall goals, and help our communications with peers and pension fund participants.

“Most importantly, they support our thinking about real world outcomes of our investments and engagements.”

Data challenges

One of the challenges, Bass says, is to create useful ratings, which demands that impact is measured and sufficiently standardised to be comparable and specific enough (eg sector-specific) to be meaningful.

She highlights the importance of advancing the availability and rigour of aggregate and comparable impact performance data, which the Giin is currently working on.

Jung explains that ISS ESG uses publicly available information, such as from news, NGOs, public authorities and verifies this data by sharing it with companies to include their feedback in the overall assessment.

Investor preference

Given the limited amount of companies that, today, have a highly positive impact and no negative impact; investors have to make choices, Jung explains.

A strong SDG strategy results in a limited investment universe and less diversification.

“If you want to do a water fund – for example, let’s say an SDG 6 fund or product – do you in that case only care about a strong positive impact on water or do you also want to avoid any negative impact on other SDGs?”

A wider view and less impactful strategy – ie investing aligned with the SDGs and in companies with a limited positive impact – would, however, generate a solid investment universe, Jung says.

Until more companies have a highly positive impact on the SDGs, investors will be forced to make these sorts of choices.","It has a significant positive impact on SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy; and SDG 13 – climate action, as it derives a large percentage of revenue from, for example, solar energy systems, electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, Jung explains.

County elected officials and staff are taking part in the Regional Emergency Response Council’s program to pack and deliver 1,500 food hampers for seniors in Cornwall and the United Counties who can’t leave their homes.

The United Way/Centraide of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry and the members of the Regional Emergency Response Council were awarded $100,343.00, funded by the Government of Canada’s New Horizons for Seniors Program. The New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP) provides grants and contributions for projects that help improve the well-being of seniors and foster their social inclusion.

“We’re thrilled to be helping our partners to ensure that our most vulnerable are able to access food while remaining in lockdown,” said SDG Warden Frank Prevost, who joined his daughters in packing food hampers Thursday at the Benson Centre in Cornwall. “We also support other ongoing efforts to help our seniors and ensure they have access to programming to ease the burden of the coronavirus pandemic.”

County library staff have offered the use of its large delivery truck to help cart food hampers to strategic locales in SDG where the material is dispersed to those in need. Many local agencies, non-profits and charitable organizations such as the County, Carefor, Seaway Valley Community Health Centre, the City of Cornwall and the Service Clubs of Cornwall to expand the offer related to food access.

If you are a senior and need help accessing food during this crisis, a centralized phone referral program, which begins with a call to 2-1-1, will best guide them to the services that they may need during this crisis. A team of professionals will answer questions and ensure individuals are referred to the right food service, be it Foodbank, grocery delivery, Meals on Wheels, or the new emergency food hamper program that best fits current needs.","The United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry is pitching in to help a program that is feeding area seniors who have been shut-in as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

SDG officially releases their new Bel-Air V3 saddle

Intense and GT were early adopters of the Bel-Air, along with the Honda G-Cross Team, pictured here using the first Bel-Air I-Beam version.

Back in 2005 the Pinkbike DH Team ran animal print Bel-Air saddles

What Has Changed Then?

- Shorter and Slimmed Down Profile:

I’ve ridden SDG saddles and almost every Bel-Air model since the early 2000s. The new V3 is slimmed down and hugely versatile. I now run it across the board, including my slalom bike, trail bike, long travel and ebike. — Kyle Strait

- Enhanced Comfort Features:

The new ""Fuel"" colorway.

- Modernized Construction and Aesthetics:

I’m proud of the new Bel-Air V3. Understanding our roots, it was important for us to keep the heritage of the Bel-Air alive. My team and I worked tirelessly to further enhance and I strongly believe that the new Bel-Air V3 will continue to keep riders satisfied in the saddle for another decade. — Tyler Anspach (SDG Owner)

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles. The SDG Bel-Air V3 extends premium craftsmanship across the full lineup and hits several price points thanks to several rail material options.

The top 12 nominated entrepreneurs will be able to pitch their products and solutions at the Summit, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021 during the Building Bridges Week and will get support to access strategic partners to scale up their venture.

According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.) to nominate from their own pipelines, up to 3 entrepreneurs which meet the eligibility criteria. Self nomination is not be accepted. The call will remain open till 15 July.

The call is for growth stage impact ventures for SDGs aimed at identifying and showcasing mature impact ventures in emerging countries with the catalytic potential to drive both large impact and yield sustainable profit.

The UNDP said 2020 the Call for Nominations only accepts Post Series A impact ventures providing products and services which reduce inequalities (with particular attention to gender inequalities) by providing solutions that empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to access to quality health, affordable and clean energy, and by reducing and recovering waste. Only ventures with headquarters, primary workforce and service provision or product market in developing countries can be eligible for the selection.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations. (Since our previous update on VNR countries, Zimbabwe no longer appears on the list of second-time presenters).

The statement titled, ‘On the Black Lives Matter Protests and other Mass Demonstrations against Systemic Racism and Police Brutality,’ stresses that, “To merely condemn expressions and acts of racism is not enough. We must go beyond and do more.” Highlighting outrage at the “injustice of racism that continues to be pervasive in our host country and across the world,” the signatories note that, as leaders in the multilateral system, it is incumbent upon them to “advocate for effective responses that would contribute to fight systemic racism, a global scourge that has been perpetuated over centuries.”

The statement highlights that 2024 will mark the end of the International Decade for People of African Descent, and indicates the leaders will use their collective voice to “contribute towards the realization of Africa’s own transformative vision contained in Agenda 2063,” which is consistent with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The 22 signatories, all of whom hold the rank of Under Secretary-General, welcome initiatives by the UN Secretary-General to strengthen the global anti-racism discourse and to address systemic racism at all levels, including by having an “honest assessment of how we uphold the UN Charter within our institution.” These leaders emphasize that they “share the core beliefs and the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations that do not leave us the option to keep silent.”

The statement was released on 14 June 2020, in the context of the global protests at the killing of George Floyd in the hands of police. June 2020 also marks the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of the UN Conference on International Organization and signature of the Charter of the United Nations. Signed on 26 June 1945, the preamble to the UN Charter identifies the determination of the peoples of the united nations to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small” as one of four defining objectives.

Finland is one of 47 countries that will present a VNR during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report, which was released by the Prime Minister’s Office, covers all 17 Goals and 169 targets of the SDG framework. It focuses on progress achieved between 2016 and 2020, and summarizes key changes and lessons learned regarding: methodology for preparing the VNR; policy and enabling environment; and means of implementation.

As noted in the foreword by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, preparation of Finland’s 2020 VNR introduced new approaches for “intensified stakeholder participation,” with several stakeholders providing their own assessment of progress. Progress on each SDG is presented in the report through two assessments: one from government officials, covering all targets; and another from civil society, providing an overall assessment of progress as well as recommendations for further progress.

The preparation process also included peer review, with the Governments of Mozambique and Switzerland reviewing the draft report and sharing their views.

At the national level, Finland’s VNR notes that a sustainability assessment has been integrated into the annual cycle of policy planning, budgeting and reporting. Environmental aspects have been easier to integrate into policy than social aspects, the report reveals.

The VNR also reflects SDG localization in Finland, noting that cities’ engagement in implementing the 2030 Agenda has increased, and three cities have prepared Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). In addition, the autonomous region of Åland has integrated the SDGs into its core strategies.

The report provides an update on two major features of Finland’s approach to sustainable development – the circular economy, and the ‘Society’s Commitment to Sustainable Development 2050.’ On circular economy, after creating the world’s first roadmap to a circular economy in 2016, its objective is now to “bring the circular economy to the core of competitiveness and economic growth strategy, transition to low-carbon energy, start considering natural resources as a scarcity and promote the shift to a sustainable lifestyle.” Per the national roadmap, Finland aims to be a leading nation in circular economy by 2025.

On the Society’s Commitment, the report describes the tool enabling anyone in Finland to register a concrete action towards the SDGs, and reports that as of March 2020 over 2,000 commitments are listed, with private companies, schools and individual citizens being the most active partners. The latest version of the platform allows users to calculate their personal carbon footprint, draw up a personal plan to reduce their footprint, and track their contribution to the national emissions reduction target.

Looking forward, the government notes that:

A national implementation plan for 2020-2025 will be submitted to the Parliament later in 2020;

In 2021, Finland will prepare a national 2030 Agenda Roadmap, to support a “systemic, long-term approach” to sustainability transformations;

The Government will commission an evaluation of national sustainable development policy in 2023;

Finland is striving for carbon neutrality by 2035; and

Finland is preparing a long-term national roadmap for increasing Finland’s Official Development Aid to 0.7% of GNI; the report notes that Finland has not yet been able to restore ODA to the level preceding budget cuts in 2016.

The government indicates that it will present its next VNR to the HLPF in 2025.

The 2020 session of the HLPF will convene from 7-16 July, most likely in an entirely virtual format. All side events and exhibitions will take place virtually. The latest programme was released on 14 May 2020.

The brief on ‘Achieving the SDGs through the COVID-19 response and recovery,’ released on 22 June 2020, reports that accelerating efforts to reach the SDGs will also better position countries to recover from COVID-19.

The SDGs can serve as preventive medicine against future shocks.

Moreover, progress on several SDGs that had been achieved before the pandemic can be seen mitigating its impacts. For example, the authors say, progress on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) has enabled more people to wash their hands regularly, an important strategy for containing the COVID-19 virus. Past progress on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and community) has reduced crowding and therefore virus exposure, and improved access to basic services. Past progress on SDG 3 has lessened pre-existing health conditions that can make COVID-19 cases more severe. Finally, progress on SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 9 (which includes internet access) have helped to mitigate the overall impacts of the pandemic.

Going forward, authors Shantanu Mukherjee and Astra Bonini suggest that the SDGs can serve as “preventive medicine against future shocks” as long as countries adopt more equitable and sustainable ways forward. These could include a just transition for workers to the green economy, elimination of fuel subsidies, and introduction of carbon taxes.

The brief also asserts that the world can move towards achieving the SDGs through “thoughtful and targeted” actions, including accelerating the universal provision of quality basic services, and protecting nature from further degradation.

DESA also issued a policy brief illuminating how forests can be “at the heart of a green recovery” from COVID-19. One aspect of this recovery is the role of healthy forests in reducing the risk of future pandemics, since habitat loss is associated with zoonotic infectious diseases. Forests also remove about one third of the world’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, thus helping to mitigate climate change, which is another driver of emerging zoonotic diseases and other epidemic diseases.

The forestry sector is labor-intensive, job training requirements are low, the work requires minimal planning and procurement, and social distancing is possible when doing forestry work. The brief identifies several countries that are utilizing forestry for job creation and including it in economic stimulus packages.

Forests serve as “safety nets for the rural poor,” providing food, income and nutritional diversity for about 20% of the global population, especially women, children, landless farmers, and other vulnerable segments of society. In addition, many indigenous peoples are coping with the pandemic by retreating deeper into forests for food, fuel and shelter, and to protect themselves from the risk of COVID-19 infection. It is also noted that reliance on firewood is likely to grow during the COVID-19 crisis, as supply chains of other energy sources get disrupted.

Finally, forests are needed to ensure availability of clean water for frequent handwashing. Three quarters of the planet’s accessible freshwater comes from forested watersheds. Forests also affect rainfall patterns, filter water, reduce soil erosion, and provide most of the drinking water for over one-third of the world’s largest cities.

Author Mita Sen highlights that a path to sustainable management of forests and trees has been charted in the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2030 with its Global Forest Goals, as well as in the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. As additions to these frameworks to support COVID-19 recovery, she suggests:

Post COVID-19 recovery programmes focused on forest-dependent people, indigenous peoples and local communities;

Investment in forestry-related jobs as part of COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages;

Strengthened national forest authorities and measures to combat illegal logging and illegal trade in wildlife; and

Timely and appropriately disaggregated official statistics on the status of forests, including on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress towards sustainable forest management.

The two policy briefs are part of a larger series being produced by DESA.

DESA plans to release the 2020 edition of the annual Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report on 7 July 2020.

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

Tiwana highlights the persistence of “MDG mindsets” and an increase in censorship and surveillance. He also suggests five ways to build a better post-pandemic world.

What have you observed about the SDG community’s responses to the pandemic?

Significant attention is being focused on the negative impacts of COVID-19, especially on impoverished and excluded communities. Important issues such as debt relief and financing for development have come to the fore. For example, the IMF announced immediate debt service relief for 25 countries in April, and further efforts are underway.

Yet, across the board, “MDG mindsets” remain stubbornly prevalent. The MDGs were weak in their comprehension of development by focusing on a small sub-set of rights. They were also charity-oriented in their approach, and reinforced top-down aid in the Global South.

The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential. However, five years since the passage of the SDGs, the impulse in many quarters is still to scale up existing approaches. A lot of the emphasis remains on “soft” communications and feel-good actions, rather than to push for fundamental changes in how our societies and economies function to better realize rights.

What impacts do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda?

COVID-19 could be a turning point. I have guarded optimism that we could overcome the paucity of ambition that has held us back from making transformative shifts.

COVID-19 has exposed and accelerated existing problems in our societies. Inequality, exclusion, and lack of voice were already marring progress on the 2030 Agenda. With COVID-19, the worst impacts are being felt by the disadvantaged as hunger and deprivation abound. Violence against women and excluded minorities has spiked. All of this is undermining the commitment to leave no one behind. Recent protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world highlight the importance of people’s participation for overcoming structural inequities and getting States to discharge their responsibilities to ensure proper health care, education, and access to justice for those most at risk. Thus, a silver lining has been renewed purpose among activists and civil society organizations to demand radical shifts to ‘leave no one behind.’

However, a less constructive trend has emerged as well. As public safety has taken center stage, censorship and surveillance have ramped up along with official propaganda. Many governments have sought to control the narrative about their pandemic response by clamping down on civic freedoms. Even before COVID-19 struck, only three percent of the world’s population lived in countries where the fundamental civic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association were adequately protected, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, our participatory research platform that measures civic space around the world.

There are worrying signs that COVID-19 emergency restrictions could be used as a smokescreen for a broader crackdown on dissent. The negative legacy of COVID-19 could last as long as the wave of dubious security measures passed in the wake of 9/11. This would undermine accountability for the 2030 Agenda.

Have any new lessons emerged that can inform plans and strategies to “build back better”?

Our vulnerabilities stand exposed by COVID-19. However, as we begin this Decade of Accountability for the SDGs (a multi-stakeholder campaign to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development), we still have an opportunity to build better forward by creating greener and fairer societies. In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.

First, civic freedoms and democratic rights are essential as our leaders are making life-or-death choices that could define the fate of generations. Concerned citizens, the media, and civil society organizations must have access to credible information and be able to exercise fundamental civic freedoms, in order to shape decisions in people’s best interests and hold decision makers to account. In a positive example in Paraguay, the government has set up a website that allows the public to track COVID-19 expenditure and engage directly with public officials.

Second, now is the time to rethink how our economies are structured. This means avoiding harsh austerity policies or market fundamentalism that prioritizes the interests of big business in recovery. To make a dent in inequality we need radical shifts such as progressive taxation and reinforcing the state’s responsibility to directly provide quality essential services. State funding for military infrastructures and repressive state apparatuses should be repurposed towards social safety nets.

We also urge better protection of worker’s rights. Towards this end CIVICUS has put in place a social security protocol to ensure job security, and to protect the mental and physical well-being of our co-workers.

Third, the needs of the most excluded people should be placed front and center. Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first. Steps must be taken to safeguard the rights of women and the health and wellbeing of older people and children, and to prevent violence against them. Economic stimulus plans should target those who are most vulnerable. For example, Spain has taken steps to introduce a basic monthly income for about a million of the country’s most impoverished households. We encourage other countries to adopt a similar policy.

It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts. CIVICUS is urging funders to exercise flexibility and listen to their partners as they navigate disruptions in programme activities and planned convenings. We also call for a greater proportion of funds to be delivered to organizations directly serving people on the ground.

Fourth, international cooperation remains vital. Multilateral institutions need to be adequately resourced and supported by governments in the spirit of multilateralism. Responses to the pandemic must strengthen and uphold the autonomy of international institutions, not only the World Health Organization but also institutions that promote human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Like pandemics, major contemporary challenges such as conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation have spillover effects beyond their borders. Strong international institutions and cooperation are needed to realize initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire.

Fifth, now is an opportune time to ramp up action on climate change. The healing of nature seen in so many places should be nurtured. New ways of working introduced during the crisis that reduce carbon footprints should continue where possible. The Paris Agreement must receive new life to ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and rises in global temperature are kept to a minimum. Recovery plans are an opportunity to invest in employment that advances the transition to a green economy.

Human rights cut across many of your proposals, for example in the need for transparency, protecting workers and the most disadvantaged, and strengthening human rights institutions. Why are human rights so relevant during COVID-19?

Countries that appear to have done better are ones that have empathetic leaders who have been inclusive in their policy responses and have involved civil society in decision making. This is all part of a human rights approach. In April this year, over 650 civil society organizations from around the world co-signed a letter calling on world leaders to respect human dignity and rights in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We can’t turn the corner towards transformation after COVID-19 without a human rights approach.

Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.

On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated “elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.

Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.

According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.

The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.

Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).

Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:

Summit on Biodiversity (proposed to reschedule to 30 September);

High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); and

High-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).

The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.

In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.

The studies also present trends and perspectives for transitioning to safe alternatives.

The studies show that these countries have all experienced an increasing trend in the use of HHPs, which can permanently undermine human health and affect future generations. HHP poisoning can lead to chronic disability or death. An overall summary of the studies provides a snapshot of each country’s HHP use.

The Russia study highlights: partial contamination of land and adjacent environments with harmful substances due to long-term use of HHPs and agrochemicals in agriculture and forestry; challenges ensuring environmental safety due to a lack of effective state supervision over the safe handling of pesticides and agrochemicals in agricultural production; and environmental pollution in areas where obsolete and banned pesticides are stored.

In Armenia, more than 60% of pesticides allowed by legislation are HHPs, with one third of them categorized as carcinogens or possible carcinogens.

Many pesticides registered and officially used in Kazakhstan contain one or more active ingredients from the HHP list. The study from explains that, as of March 2019, 74 active ingredients belonging to HHPs are used in Kazakhstan, with 25 of the active ingredients banned in other countries. Of the 1,021 trade names of pesticides registered in Kazakhstan, 386 contain one or more active HHP substance.

In Uzbekistan, 59 HHPs are allowed for use, 34 of which are banned in other countries. Uzbekistan has established a database of laws and regulations governing the production, use, injury, and liability of individuals and legal entities and the sound management of chemicals, including the registration, licensing, and prevention of stockpiling of hazardous chemicals.

In Ukraine, the study concludes that among 3,966 preparatory forms of pesticides, 1,125 formulations contain one to three active ingredients of HHPs. Thus, around one third of pesticides and agrochemicals allowed for use in Ukraine are HHPs. Eighty-three active ingredients of HHPs in preparative forms of pesticides and agrochemicals are allowed for use in Ukraine, 41 of which are already prohibited in other countries.

Recommendations include: reducing and eventually eliminating HHPs in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia through increased information on safe HHP substitution, including use of the ecosystem-based approach and traditional knowledge in agriculture; and Regional Focal Points to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) collecting lessons learned from this process and sharing them with national officials to facilitate the switch from HHPs to safer alternatives.

The executive summaries are in English, while the full reports are provided in Russian. The studies were undertaken as a part of IPEN’s Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign, which focuses on international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral cooperation to support chemical safety and sound chemicals management and waste objectives beyond 2020. The Campaign contends that advancing chemical safety is necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It seeks to engage civil society organizations to further advance its objectives.

The studies are related to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land).

IPEN Participating Organizations have been undertaking activities related to the Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign since 2018. Activities address agroecology, chemicals in products, endocrine disrupting chemicals or POPs, hazardous chemicals in the lifecycle of electronics, HHPs, lead in paint, women and chemicals, workplace right-to-know, and/or zero waste issues.

COVID-19 comes just as the public was beginning, slowly, to come to terms with the climate crisis and its far-reaching implications. The pandemic highlights how interconnected we are, and how impossible it is to disentangle the problems we all face in a globalized world. Holistic approaches to these problems are needed and they are needed fast. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), an umbrella term to describe a wide array of ecosystem-based actions that incorporate the natural environment to mitigate climate change and ensure ecosystem sustainability, has grown in prominence in recent years as potentially being such an approach.

Many companies are increasingly aware of the impact their unsustainable commodity production has on the environment and are recognizing that business cannot thrive in a world of environmental stress, poverty, and uncertainty. Some of those companies are starting to plan and implement preventive and restorative actions within their operations, with NbS providing a cost-effective tool to create a seemingly more responsible and sustainable forest-risk commodity value chain.

Detailed information on how companies are carrying out NbS within their operations, however, is still lagging. In a recent briefing, CDP analysed its 2019 Forests disclosure data on 543 companies that gathered information about the integration of NbS into their operations. We found that only 15% of companies reported having implemented any form of NbS, as well as a lack of consistency amongst those who did. The results spoke a clear message: we have a long way to go to encourage more widespread and ambitious implementation of NbS. As stated in the recent #TogetherWithNature statement, NbS must be considered a complementary approach to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, in addition to following a pathway of decarbonization, enacting comprehensive climate policies and enforcing proper accountability.

In the last year, NbS has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions on the environmental crisis. They featured heavily in the UN Climate Action Summit, particularly in the NbS Coalition co-led by China and New Zealand. At COP 25 in December, NbS were constituted a central theme in the high-level segments and the Santiago Call for Action on Forests. NbS are also set to take centre-stage in the negotiations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. For the private sector, it pays to be transparent, as businesses that disclose and take leading action on climate change can better identify and measure their environmental risks and opportunities. Data from STOXX has shown that CDP’s ‘A List’ has outperformed its global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a 7-year period.

The private sector presents a largely untapped opportunity for the implementation of NbS, when implemented in accordance with the best available science-based targets and with appropriate safeguards. As the COVID-19 crisis recedes, policymakers should seize the political momentum for the 2021 – 2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and recognize the role and participation of non-state actors in driving NbS, creating regulatory environments that are both institutionally and financially conducive for all stakeholders to take ambitious, measurable action. To start, they could:

1. Encourage corporate environmental disclosure

Disclosure is the bedrock of action. Corporate environmental disclosure needs to be more transparent and common, including for NbS. For this to occur, there needs to be improved regulatory frameworks to promote transparency in supply chains, fostering the integration of environmental protection assessments in business operations.

2. Mainstream NbS into legislation and regulatory frameworks for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development

Situating NbS as a cross-cutting policy tool within NDCs, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the SDGs (especially SDGs 12, 13 and 15) would not only help with the implementation of projects but would promote more accurate measurement of their effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

3. Improve the criteria, metrics and measurement of NbS

Whilst NbS are present in the majority of NDCs submitted to date, most of these do not include quantifiable targets. In order to harness private sector potential on the implementation of NbS and be part of a coherent global response to climate and biodiversity, there must be adequate and science-backed targets outlining the direction of action.

International policy efforts have multiple windows of opportunity to introduce integrated solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, and human development. All these issues are underpinned by our relationship with nature. Policymakers and corporate actors must engage in mutually supportive, ambitious, and carefully implemented action, to ensure that the potential of nature to be an important part of the solution to the current crises is unlocked.

The post-2020 approach to international chemicals management had been scheduled to be adopted during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020. The pandemic caused the postponement of the final preparatory meeting for ICCM5 a few weeks before it was scheduled to take place at the end of March 2020, along with the postponement of ICCM5 itself. Both events are now expected to take place in 2021.

During a webinar organized by the Geneva Environment Network to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sound management of chemicals and waste, Nalini Sharma, SAICM Secretariat, noted that the Strategic Approach’s work is connected to the pandemic, particularly through the issue of waste management. She highlighted challenges for SAICM Beyond 2020, including linkages to other agendas, such as biodiversity and climate change. She added that a discussion on linkages between the SAICM Beyond 2020 and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework processes includes identifying activities for better coordination between the two clusters.

Three options for the rescheduled preparatory meeting were identified by Valentina Sierra, Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN in Geneva. One option under consideration is early March 2021 in Bucharest, Romania, where it was originally scheduled to take place in March 2020. The other two options are early March 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with the fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 5), in Nairobi, Kenya, or early July 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with ICCM5 itself, in Bonn, Germany. ICCM5 has been rescheduled to take place from 5-9 July 2021, in Bonn, Germany.

Sierra reported that small virtual working groups, open online briefings, and submissions of written comments could also contribute to the finalization of outcomes for SAICM Beyond 2020, for adoption at ICCM5. She also called attention to the work of the High-Level Ambition Alliance for chemicals and waste, which seeks to raise awareness and ensure commitment for action on chemicals and waste management.

WHO has estimated that sound chemicals management could prevent at least 1.6 million deaths per year.

Representatives from Geneva-based UN agencies discussed the linkages between chemicals management and the issues that their organizations focus on. Manal Azzi, Senior Specialist on Occupational Safety and Health, International Labour Organization (ILO), stressed the importance of the ILO in the chemicals’ field, notably because of workers’ exposure to chemicals along the entire supply chain. Carolyn Vickers, Head, Chemical Safety and Health Unit, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized the WHO Chemicals Roadmap, and establishment of a global chemicals and health network, where national ministries network to facilitate the implementation of the roadmap. Vickers highlighted that at least 1.6 million deaths could be prevented annually by the sound management of chemicals and waste.

Discussing the role of civil society in the Beyond 2020 process, Giulia Carlini, Center for International Environmental Law, said the July 2021 ICCM5 and BRS COPs in Bonn, Germany, would disadvantage non-European participants. She said an online process, including virtual working group sessions and technical briefings, should ensure meaningful and effective participation going forward.

The webinar was part of the GENeva Environment Dialogues’ special bi-weekly COVID-19 series, which focuses on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global environmental agenda.","The post-2020 approach to international chemicals management had been scheduled to be adopted during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020.

During a silence procedure for his election, it was announced that a secret ballot had been requested. The vote by secret ballot will take place on 17 June in the UNGA Hall.

According to the Assembly’s practice of regional rotation among Member States, the President for UNGA 75 is to be selected from the Western European and Other States Group (WEOG). In February 2020, the Group endorsed Bozkir as candidate for the 2020-2021 presidency. Bozkir is a former Member of Parliament in Turkey and former Minister for EU Affairs.

According to his vision statement for the 75th session, Bozkir pledges to support implementation of the UN reform agenda and the 2020 vision of the UN Secretary-General. He indicates that he will prioritize three issues:

Underlining the irreplaceable nature of the rules-based international system and the importance of multilateralism, taking advantage of the UN’s 75th anniversary;

Addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, people in need, and people under oppression, such as refugees, immigrants, and stateless persons, and ensuring delivery of humanitarian assistance and respect for international humanitarian law; and

Focusing on SDG implementation in countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs).

His vision statement also expresses support for the Secretary-General’s objective of achieving gender parity at all levels at the UN. Bozkir highlights the UNGA’s high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held on 23 September 2020 in the margins of the 75th general debate.

A virtual dialogue between the candidate and Member States took place on 15 May 2020. On 27 May the current UNGA President, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande commenced a silence procedure for Member States to elect Bozkir. Silence procedure has been used to take UNGA decisions while in-person meetings are not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, on 2 June Muhammad-Bande announced that a request had been made for a vote via secret ballot. The vote will take place on 17 June, simultaneously with the election of non-permanent members of the UN Security Council and members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

To conduct the secret ballot, each UN Member State will register one representative to enter the UNGA Hall at a designated time to cast their ballot. Muhammad-Bande will oversee the proceedings in the Hall, and the election tellers will observe the election and certify the result.

More information on the procedure is provided in a letter to Member States. [Volkan Bozkir Biography]","During a silence procedure for his election, it was announced that a secret ballot had been requested.

The seventh edition of the ILPPW, held from 20-26 October 2019, raised awareness and promoted actions to address the human health effects of lead exposure, especially in children. It sought to urge governments without legal limits on lead in paint to establish and implement limits, building on the Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint, which helps countries develop their own legally binding controls.

ILPPW 7 also urged industry in countries where legal limits are not yet in place to voluntarily stop the manufacture, import, and sale of paint with lead, and civil society to engage with governments and industry to support the development and implementation of legislation. The week also focused on the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM)-Global Environment Facility (GEF) project to increase the number of countries phasing out lead paint.

The ILPPW was organized by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) through the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance), a voluntary initiative to catalyze efforts to achieve international goals to prevent children’s exposure to lead from paint and to minimize occupational exposures to lead paint.

Eighty-nine events were registered on the WHO website for the ILPPW by governments, NGOs, the paint industry, academia, and other event organizers. Events took place in Bangladesh, Georgia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, and Panama, among others.

The WHO report on the Week describes demonstrations calling for action on lead paint, stakeholder meetings, educational activities in schools, social media communications, television and radio broadcasts, information stands in public areas, and calls for legislative action.

The Lead Paint Alliance provided a campaign resource package focused on: increased awareness on risk and hazards of lead and lead paint; raising awareness and promoting action to prevent lead poisoning, particularly in children; and banning lead paint by working with national governments and stakeholders to establish laws to eliminate lead paint, and to ensure effective enforcement of lead paint regulations. Other resources include: a fact sheet that outlines steps to help countries adopt laws, an annual report describing the status of lead paint laws in countries as of September 2019, and an interactive map and database that provides information on the status of lead paint laws in countries, including regulations and controls.

In the wake of the crisis, visibility and urgency on issues such as climate change, income inequality and human rights have risen and the five-step framework seeks to support investors in creating investment outcomes that are aligned with the UN goals, the PRI said in its report.

It comes as the investor organisation, with $89trn (€78trn) in assets managed by its signatories, has registered an increase in its members mentioning the SDGs in their reporting, with 650 in 2020, compared to 418 last year.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that meeting the 17 SDGs by 2030 will require $5trn to $7trn per year from the private sector, the PRI report said.

To support the SDGs, investors need to increase the positive outcomes and decrease the negative outcomes of their actions.

Investors need to redirect existing capital and engage with investees to improve positive outcomes.

The PRI report states that there is a continuous feedback cycle between environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities and (SDG-aligned) outcomes, shaped by investor actions (see figure 2 below).

This applies particularly for ‘universal owners’, who are long-term investors and so large that they hold a slice of the overall market.

“For such investors, overall economic performance will influence the future value of their portfolios more than the performance of individual companies or sectors, incentivising them to support sustainable growth and well-functioning financial markets,” the report noted.

Focusing on SDG outcomes allows investors to, for example:

identify opportunities, such as through changes to business models, across supply chains and through new and expanded products and services;

prepare for and respond to legal and regulatory developments, including those that may lead to asset stranding; and

protect their reputation and licence-to-operate (eg the trust of beneficiaries, clients and other stakeholders), particularly in the event of negative outcomes from investments.

The framework follows previous work by the PRI on the SDG investment case in 2017 and is the starting point for more work on the subject. It will also be the basis for future guidance and support, the report explained.

Next steps

Going forward, the PRI will work with signatories, who seek to shape outcomes in line with the SDGs, to provide best practices and develop a consensus on how to address common challenges, it said.

The PRI will also include an initial set of questions on shaping real-world outcomes in the pilot year of its new reporting framework in 2021.

Junko Nakagawa, president and chief executive of Nomura Asset Management, commented: “It is clear that large asset managers have a crucial role to play in supporting outcomes in line with the SDGs through both investments in equities and engagement with publicly-listed companies.

“Whilst we recognise the difficulties associated with pursuing impact through public investing for certain SDG targets, large public companies are among the most important stakeholders for achieving success. These companies have the resources, scale and investment power to bridge the huge funding gaps, while major asset managers are uniquely positioned to engage with these companies and help to enhance their impact.”

Darryl Murphy, managing director, infrastructure at Aviva Investors, said: “As long-term investors, we believe infrastructure – and real assets more broadly – have a critical role to play in moving towards a truly sustainable future.

“[The SDGs] help us to define objectives for a project and shape terms and conditions of an investment agreement, ensuring that borrowers adhere to certain practices and standards over the long-term.”

Below is the Nigeria Country Report No. 2020/177, titled ""Nigeria: Technical Assistance Report-Additional Spending Toward Sustainable Development Goals"", issued in April 2020.

Preface

In response to a request from the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), a technical mission visited Abuja, Nigeria during January 29-February 11, 2020 to collaborate on an assessment of the spending associated with making substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mission comprised Mauricio Soto (head) and Mariano Moszoro (all FAD), and Julieth Pico (FAD expert).

This technical mission was financed by the European Union under the EU-IMF Public Financial Management Partnership Program (PFM-PP).

The mission was hosted by D.M. Dauda (Secretary of Programme, OSSAP-SDGs) and Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa (Senior Technical Advisor, OSSAP-SDGs).

The mission met with Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed (Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning), Prince Clem Ikanade Agba (Minister of State for Budget and National Planning), and Suleiman H, Adamu (Minister of Water Resources). The mission also met with Didi Walson-Jack (Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power), Emmanuel Meribole (Director, Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Health), Babangida Hussaini (Director of Special Projects, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing), and Adeoye E.O. (Acting Director, Department of Educational Planning, Research, and Development, Federal Ministry of Education).

The mission also met Katrine Mulvad Thomsen (Team Leader, Economic Cooperation and Energy, European Union Delegation), Amarakoon Bandara (Senior Economic Advisor, UNDP), Shubham Chaudhuri (Country Director, World Bank), Moses Ongom (Health System Adviser, WHO), Anthony Simpasa (Lead Economist, African Development Bank), and other staff of development partners.

The mission expresses its sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support given by officials and staff of these various organizations with whom the mission met. The team is especially grateful to Chukwuemeka Olanrewaju Ogbuehi (Ministry of Finance), Ogunleye Femi (OSSAPSDG), and Zainab Mangga (IMF Resident Representative Office) for the excellent coordination and support during the mission. The mission is also thankful to Laraba Bonet (IMF Resident Representative Office) for facilitating mission logistics.

Since the mission took place before COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the report does not reflect the impact from COVID-19 on economic activity in Nigeria. The report focuses on some of the medium-term challenges that Nigeria will face after the COVID-19 crisis, namely the additional spending needed to ensure substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Executive Summary

Making progress in the SDGs requires substantial additional resources. Concomitant with the reform priorities identified by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and other international development institutions, the mission estimates additional spending of 18 percentage points of GDP by 2030-a level higher than the average low-income and developing countries. Relative to other low-income and developing countries, additional spending is higher in education and water and sanitation, and lower in health, electricity, and roads (Figure).

Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. The authorities have made important progress in developing long-term plans in sectors such as health, electricity, and water and sanitation.

Education-increasing access and improving quality. The relatively low resources devoted to education are insufficient to deliver quality education for all. With 50 percent of the population in school-age, we estimate that total annual spending in education would need to increase by 7.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. A pragmatic approach should be taken depending on resource availability. For example, expanding enrollment could be done at a more modest cost of some 1 percentage points of GDP.

Health-tackling inefficiencies. Nigeria should deliver better outcomes at its current level of spending. Rebalancing the system, with an emphasis on primary care with public support, is critical. In the medium-term, additional annual spending of 4 percentage points of GDP would be needed to expand health workers, improve infrastructure, and improve health outcomes.

Electricity-rehabilitating and expanding power infrastructure. Annual investments of 1 percent of GDP are needed to expand electricity access and keep up with population growth. Rehabilitating the existing capacity can help meeting part of these investments. Mini-grids can play an important role in mobilizing capacity to remote and vulnerable communities.

Roads-expanding the road network. Increasing access roads from 26 to 75 percent of the rural population will cost 2 percent of annual GDP. It is critical to outline the road network and identify projects with high economic and social returns. The private sector can play an important role in this sector, supported by strong oversight to ensure value for money.

Water and sanitation-picking low-hanging fruit. A priority is improving access for the most vulnerable. Ending open defecation and expanding basic water and sanitation can be achieved at a modest annual cost of 0.6 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, providing safely managed water and sanitation for all will cost an additional 2.5 percent of annual GDP.





Beyond resources, improving coordination and strengthening governance is critical to delivering on the SDGs. The federal administration through its Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) is committed to advance towards the 2030 goals. In line with policy options outlined by the World Bank and the United Nations, progress in these sectors requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by strong coordination between the federal, state, and local administrations.

While development partners and the private sector can help, the government should be in the driving seat of these efforts. To support decision-making based on evidence, one priority is to collect and analyze data to inform best practices and better target scarce resources.

107,https://www.morrisburgleader.ca/2020/06/25/sdg-county-backs-call-for-review-of-farm-tax/,"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Morrisburg Leader,SDG County backs call for review of farm tax,"SDG – County councillors voted June 15th to support a resolution by requesting the province of Ontario review the Farm Property Class Tax Rate.

The rate program was developed 22 years ago when the Mike Harris government overhauled farm property taxation, simplifying the structure.

SDG’s support of the resolution by Mapleton Township, northwest of Guelph, calls for the government’s program to be reviewed due to the burden it has shifted to other tax classes for municipal taxation.

Before the program launched, farms paid the full amount of property tax for the land used for agriculture production to a municipality. The land owners then would receive a rebate of approximately 75 per cent of the property tax paid from the province. Under the current program, agriculture land is taxed at one-quarter the residential tax rate by municipalities and the rebate eliminated. The impact to urban municipalities has been minimal, but for rural municipalities, the revenue issues are substantial.

“The tax burden has shifted more to residential owners,” said councillor Steven Byvelds (South Dundas). “If you have other industries that you can spread that tax burden, it helps.”

Byvelds pointed to South Dundas, which has some industrial businesses, but not as many as when the program started 22 years ago.

“We had a lot more manufacturing here then,” he said. “There still is some in South Dundas, and we’re grateful for that.”

Some municipalities in SDG have taken a larger hit on their finances under the province’s two-decade long taxation program, in part due to the province’s reductions in the Ontario Municipal Partnerships Fund. That fund was set up to help compensate municipalities for the revenue shortfall after 1998 when the farm class taxation program went into effect. That reduction has become a double whammy for one municipality within the county.

At just under 7,000 in population, North Stormont has seen the impact of farm tax class issues impact their budget even more.

“We’ve seen dramatic cuts in OMPF funding and that has been balanced off with increases in assessment,” said councillor Jim Wert (North Stormont). “The impact has been reduced somewhat because of partnership agreements but the reality is without Lafleche, we’d be looking at double-digit tax increases yearly.”

Lafleche Environmental Services in Moose Creek is the largest single industrial taxpayer in North Stormont.

“I think we’re all prepared to pay our share,” Wert said. “But I also feel it’s an opportunity given the financial challenges at the provincial and federal level that we would be wise to ask.”

The resolution calls for the program to be reviewed as it was originally supposed to be revenue neutral, with funding offsets provided by the OMPF.

“A review is overdue,” Byvelds said. “We need to see if its the right way, if the tax formula is right for the needs of everyone, and it’s a fair system.”

The UN office in Uganda is awaiting confirmation from the president to launch a youth innovative campaign for solutions to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals were adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.



They focus more on achieving a world free of poverty and hunger, one with good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, climate action, peace, justice and strong institutions.



The United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango said that through the initiative, the UN will launch an innovative campaign of 1 million SDG solutions giving the youth a chance to showcase how they can solve the country's development challenges.

Malango was speaking at the handover the second Voluntary National Review Report on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Uganda to the Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga by the Minister in Charge of General Duties in the Office of the Prime Minister, Mary Karooro Okurut.



The Voluntary National Review encourages countries to conduct self-assessment to identify challenges and map strategic interventions for the progress of the goals. The Report highlights the progress made in integrating and implementing SDGs in Uganda's development planning frameworks.



Malango says the submission of the Review report is a clear signal that Uganda embraces accountability to international frameworks. Uganda ranked 18 out of 52 African countries based on 97 indicators across all SDGs. The UN Resident Coordinator said that the country has an overall score of 54.8 per cent which is higher than the regional average of 52.7 per cent.



Minister Okurut, who is Cabinet’s focal person on SDGs, called for more support in Parliament, especially in the promotion and adoption of people-centred policies and legislation to ensure that no one is left behind.



The Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga praised Malango for having adamantly pushed the Prime Minister to ensure that Cabinet appointed a specific minister to oversee the implementation and achievement of SDG Targets. She pledged to ensure that the budget process and oversight focuses on achieving the development Agenda as outlined.

Article content The 1st Battalion of the Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders celebrate its 80th anniversary Saturday. Tim Gault’s father, Ralph Gault, was a member of the 1st Battalion of the Highlanders, a Second World War veteran. He’s been associated with the group since 1929, when he signed on with a regiment when he was 13 years old. He served as a lieutenant and ended his career as a captain after many stints overseas.

SDG Highlanders mark battalion's 80th anniversary Back to video The 1st Battalion was formed with officers and men coming from four eastern Ontario Units – Headquarters Company from The Prince of Wales Rangers (Peterborough), A Company from The Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment (Kingston), B Company from The Brockville Rifles (Brockville), and C Company, D Company, and the Band from our Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders (Cornwall). The Highlanders were received orders to form the battalion and its start dates to June 20, 1940. The Glens became part of the 3rd Division’s 9th Brigade — the Highland Brigade — with The Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders, The Highland Light Infantry, and The North Nova Scotia Highlanders

Article content Gault attended and qualified as a sergeant signal instructor at the Royal Canadian Corp of Signals in Camp Borden. “He instructed and trained the SDG Highlanders signal platoon through the 1930s,” said Gault. “He was the RSM, which stands for regimental sergeant major, of the Cornwall Collegiate Institute, a cadet core in 1932 and later as a lieutenant, organized and instructed a school of cadets.” Gault Sr. was appointed to the 2nd Battalion of the Highlanders and then volunteered for active service and attended the officer’s training school, went on to instruct at two training centres before being posted to England in 1943. “In England, he attended two battle schools, and qualified at the anti-tank school in England,” said Gault. “He then instructed in anti-tank warfare. He went from the 2nd Battalion to the 1st Battalion, being the active force in Europe.” Gault was wounded just before the liberation of Boulogne. He became an active supporter of the 1st Battalion Association, helping organizing tours, arranging for memorial plaques, and planning reunions. The association recognized him as an honourary life member. “My father was wounded, hit by shrapnel by a German motor grenade, wounded in the right side of his head, forearm and leg,” said Gault. “He was evacuated to England.” He spent four months in the hospital, next four to five months on rehabilitation and training reinforcements – anti tank – and was then appointed chief instructor later on.

He passed away in 2001. “When my mother passed away in 1984, he got back involved with the 1st Battalion Association and I got involved with it as well, because he and I did pretty much everything together,” said Gault. The battalion’s association would normally hold an in-person reunion around the anniversary of D-Day on June 6, which was cancelled this year due the pandemic. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Hospitals in Cornwall/SDG to resume services Supplied

Article content Hospitals in the region are starting to increasing services as the number of active COVID-19 has dropped and remains low. This comes as the provincial government entered Stage 2 of its economic reopening within the Eastern Ontario Health Unit. Per the guidelines, the process will take weeks and months. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Hospitals in Cornwall/SDG to resume services Back to video “Our initial focus has been surgeries and endoscopies, which is really part of the surgical services,” said Cholly Boland, chief executive officer of Winchester District Memorial Hospital. “We’re beginning to ramp up those services. “We have both patients that have been waiting for several months, literally, and patients were presenting today. We are scheduling the patients with the most pressing needs, whether it’s a need that has progressed over the last few months or it’s a need that presents today.” Hospitals in the region are collaborating to meet the provincial requirements prior to increasing services. Provincial criteria include a lower-than-average number of patients in hospitals across the region, appropriate staffing levels, and a sufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) among other conditions, according to a news release. Boland spoke to WDMH, but the same steps and procedures are being taken at Cornwall Community Hospital and at Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria.

Hospital are also ramping up their outpatient services in clinics that are staffed by physicians. Visits where patients walked in to speak to a physician have continued virtually. They will however, continue in-person visits where the doctor needs to do an examination or procedure. “Within a couple of weeks, we hope to be up to about 50 to 60 per cent of the number of volumes we saw pre-COVID, but the hospitals are a different place right now and will be for the foreseeable future,” said Boland. “Everyone is wearing a mask, everyone has to distance themselves when they come in and take enhanced precautions.” There are only a number of procedures they can conduct in the operating room during the day as there are enhanced preparations between cases. “In all likelihood, we won’t get up to 100 per cent of what we were before pre-COVID,” said Boland. “If we are, it’ll take a good long while now. By the same token, we also have to be prepared if by some chance, in a couple of months, another wave comes by and we’ll have to actually ramp down.” The hospital is limiting the amount of people in the waiting room and in the operating room. Staff members have placed tape on the ground to ensure a safe distance is met.

Patients that enter the emergency room are served based on who needs immediate care first. “What we’re talking about are people who didn’t require emergency or urgent care in March, maybe by virtue of them having to wait, their conditions has become serious and those are the people we want to address,” said Boland. “We continue to do emergency surgeries and emergency services as we always have. It’s the next level of priority that we’re addressing now and we do have a bit of a backlog on that, not only a daily basis but looking at the last few months.” Hospitals are prepared for a second wave of COVID-19. Boland said they may have to ramp down services again as they did in March. That will be dependent on the environment and situation, such as if the rate of infection is greater or if there’s a greater demand on services for COVID-19. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Only one of the 2020 regional forums on sustainable development was held as scheduled. Three were postponed, and one was scaled down and held virtually due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The note (E/HLPF/2020/3) states that the regional commissions have convened regional forums on sustainable development since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to “discuss follow-up and review of the Agenda at the regional level and to prepare for the reviews of the high-level political forum.”

The sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development was held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, from 24-27 February 2020. The forum convened on the theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ bringing together more than 3,000 participants, including ministers and government representatives from 52 UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) member States, intergovernmental organizations, UN bodies and specialized agencies, major groups, and other stakeholders.

According to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add. 1), the forum provided an opportunity to translate into action the proclamation of the 2020s as a decade of action and delivery for sustainable development, endorsed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in resolution 74/4. The principal activities carried out during the forum included: regional follow-up and review of progress made in implementing the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; peer learning through sharing approaches, experiences, and lessons learned in conducting voluntary national and local reviews; and identifying and articulating priorities, policy options, and recommendations of Africa in the form of key messages.

Key messages emanated from:

the high-level panel on accelerators to deliver a transformed and prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 within the decade 2020-2030;

discussions of the progress report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 at the regional and subregional levels;

plenary round tables on: voluntary national reviews (VNRs) on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; VNRs and peer learning on implementation, follow-up, and review of the two agendas; the sub-theme of people; and the sub-theme of partnerships;

parallel meetings on the sub-themes of prosperity, the planet, and peace;

the 2020 session of the Africa Science, Technology and Innovation Forum;

major groups and other stakeholders;

deliberations on support from the UN development system to implement the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063; and

a youth forum.

In the outcome document from the forum, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the United Nations Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ forum participants call upon all African countries to “urgently revisit frameworks for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063” and to “align their national development plans with the principles of the two agendas.” They call upon the UN development system and partners to scale up support of African countries’ capacity development in “transformational” areas such as climate action, youth, education, entrepreneurship and innovation, empowerment of women and persons with disabilities, food systems, health, data and statistics, and trade, among others.

The fourth session of the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the Economic Commission for Europe Region took place virtually on 19 March 2020. Participants from UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) member States, UN entities and other international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, the private sector, and other organizations discussed: accelerating action and delivery for sustainable development in the region; accelerating SDG progress through VNRs; actions for green and inclusive change; and economic transformation, finance, and technology for SDG acceleration. Additional segments held as webinars addressed SDG challenges and leveraging data and statistics for SDG progress.

The Chair’s summary of the discussions, annexed to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.2), highlights that, despite good progress in many areas of sustainable development, in Europe, no country is on track to achieving the SDGs, citing “considerable challenges” with SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).

Discussions sought to identify the main lessons learned from the VNR process and ways to improve reviews in the next HLPF cycle. Participants shared experiences from Azerbaijan, Romania, Switzerland, the Russian Federation, and civil society.

Originally scheduled from 25-27 March, the seventh session of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was held virtually on 20 May 2020, with more than 730 registered participants from governments, intergovernmental organizations, the UN, international organizations, civil society, and other entities. The forum focused on the theme, ‘Accelerating Action for and Delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific.’

Participants discussed actions supporting the global decade of action for the SDGs in the region, focusing on the transformative processes needed to face socioeconomic, cultural, and institutional barriers to change, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The forum also provided an opportunity to share examples of successful strategic policies in the region and national and regional perspectives on strengthening the follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda.

The Chair’s summary of the discussions, annexed to the input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.3), identifies six transformative entry points to accelerate progress, derived from the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019: human well-being and capabilities; sustainable and just economies; food systems and nutrition patterns; affordable and clean energy; urban and peri-urban development; and global environmental commons. It notes that stronger follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda need to be part of the solution, and cites a call for stronger links between the regional and global processes for reviewing the 2030 Agenda.

The fourth meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, originally scheduled to be held in Havana, Cuba, from 28-31 March 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 and 12 May, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) organized two virtual meetings of the community of practice of the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries submitting VNRs to the HLPF in 2020.

The input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.4) highlights ‘Sustainable Development Goal Gateway’ – an inter-agency regional knowledge platform that serves as an entry point to all the information on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs in the region, and a document titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the New Global and Regional Context: Scenarios and Projections in the Current Crisis,’ which gives an overview of the main economic, social, and environmental trends that influence the achievement of the SDGs in LAC and offers analysis of progress on the basis of 72 statistical series of SDG indicators in the region.

In light of the “weak and uneven progress” towards the SDGs and the response to the pandemic, ECLAC puts forward the following recommendations:

Coordinate a powerful fiscal stimulus at the international level to support health services and to protect jobs and the income of people in general;

Keep international supply chains open, in particular those for medicine and medical equipment, food and energy;

Bolster mechanisms to guarantee companies’ liquidity, payment chains and the stability of the financial system;

Defer external debt servicing for highly indebted countries to increase their fiscal space; and

Develop new financial instruments to directly support countries with little to no fiscal space.

The input document also summarizes discussions held during virtual meetings of ECLAC subsidiary bodies and regional dialogue platforms to advance the 2030 Agenda amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The input document (E/HLPF/2020/3/Add.5) from the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development notes that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting of the forum, due to be held from 7-9 April 2020, was postponed until a later date that “has yet to be decided.” The document indicates that the forum’s programme of work will be updated to “include consideration of the challenges arising from the pandemic and its implications for health care, its socioeconomic consequences and its impact on progress towards sustainable development in the Arab region.”

The input document contains key messages to the HLPF, drawn from consultations with representatives of the Arab States during two regional workshops on VNRs, organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the League of Arab States. The messages address the following themes:","The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) published a note consolidating inputs to the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) from the five UN regional commissions.

112,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/global-trade-the-pandemic-and-multilateral-directions/,"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: Global Trade, the Pandemic, and Multilateral Directions","This year opened with the expectation that trade issues would be one of several key “2020” areas of focus for advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG target 17.11 is one of 21 targets with a “2020” deadline (Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ (LDCs) share of global exports by 2020). Likewise, SDG target 14.6 calls for, by 2020, prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, while those subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing are to be eliminated entirely. After nearly 20 years, World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations were closing in on concluding talks on this issue. The WTO Ministerial Conference was set to convene in June 2020, with many eyeing the event as an opportunity to address these and other pressing trade issues, some of which have languished for years.

Instead, the year 2020 will be recalled for very different reasons for the global trade regime. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, including international trade flows. News about trade policy during the last few months has, in many ways, provided a barometer on the unfolding, multi-pronged crisis. As borders closed to stem the human-to-human spread of the virus, implications for trade in essential medical supplies were quickly singled out as priorities for exceptions. The need for continued trade in essential supplies also brought the inequalities that the pandemic exposed into focus. Moreover, the need for collective action to ensure intellectual property rules (IPRs) do not create a hindrance to the crisis response has also been raised in the context of the World Health Organization, where the final COVID-19 resolution includes language referring to the use of previously agreed flexibilities in the WTO’s IPR rules. The growing number of export restrictions on agricultural goods has raised concerns over whether a repeat of past food price crises and a rise in global hunger levels and food insecurity may be on the horizon.

While there were acknowledgements that the extraordinary circumstances justified breaching global agreements or taking advantage of their existing flexibilities, there have also been calls to ensure that multilateral approaches resume as soon as possible, along with reminders that multilateralism will be essential to efforts to build back better.

Furthermore, leadership changes have added to the uncertainties that the pandemic has wrought, while also focusing attention on what is needed to emerge stronger from the pandemic. The May 2020 announcement by World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo of his surprise decision to step down launched a “politically charged” selection process for the next Director-General, despite having a full year remaining in his second term. His successor’s task will be to help the multilateral trading system respond to new economic realities caused by COVID-19.

The SDG Knowledge Hub is publishing news about these and more trade-related policy developments, thanks to support from the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). The summary below offers a brief overview of the news during the last two months. We encourage you to visit our “Trade” coverage webpage often.

COVID-19 Puts Development Gains at Risk

As projections of the extent of the damage caused by the global pandemic are revised downward, there are growing concerns about sustainable recovery and resilience of the global economic system to future crises.

Already back in April, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a new debt crisis, and recommended actions to build back better for sustainable development, including the elimination of trade barriers and restrictions that affect supply chains. In a Communiqué following its virtual meeting on 17 April, the World Bank Development Committee recognized the pandemic’s “exceptional negative shock” on the global economy and disruptions to trade, supply chains, and investment flows, warning about its potential to “erase development gains for many countries.”

The same month, the WTO forecast that world trade would fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the pandemic. A May 2020 report by the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that COVID-19 had cut global trade values by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, projecting the decline to accelerate, with an expected 27% quarter-on-quarter decline.

The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2020 found that the coronavirus pandemic had caused a “steep drop” in investment flows, hitting developing countries the hardest. During an informal briefing among UN system leaders to discuss building on the UN’s operational framework for social and economic responses to the pandemic, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Mona Juul cited “incomprehensible setbacks to our hard-won development goals” due to COVID-19.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report warned that LDCs, land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, insufficient social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade. Among trade-related impacts in LDCs, a WTO information note highlighted a “significant decline in export earnings” among these countries since the outbreak of COVID-19, which may affect their graduation prospects.

Overcoming the Pandemic

As the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has suggested, the pace of post-COVID-19 recovery will depend on the length of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of policy responses. Over the past months, world leaders, UN agencies, and relevant stakeholders have engaged on various levels to address the crisis and chart the path towards global recovery.

Some of the actions, many of which were spearheaded by the WTO or groups of WTO Members, included:

The Ottawa Group, comprised of 13 WTO Members and devoted to developing options for reforming the organization, outlined six action areasto focus on in light of COVID-19: transparency and withdrawal of trade-restrictive measures; keeping open and predictable trade in agricultural and agrifood products; e-commerce; trade facilitation through the use of information technology and streamlined procedures; an initiative on medical supplies; and deepening engagement with stakeholders.

During the 1 July meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Services, many WTO Members highlighted the importance of sharing experiences, including on trade facilitating measures adopted to address the crisis and promote economic recovery.

The WTO and six multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint statementhighlighting measures taken to step up trade finance programmes to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WTO’s ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020’ report featured market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies as the “special topic.”

The WTO’s 23rd biannual monitoring reporton trade measures, covering the period from mid-October 2019 to mid-May 2020, found that Group of 20 (G20) economies implemented 154 new trade or trade-related measures over the time period, of which 60% were linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several G20 ministerialsconvened in April, many of which were special meetings devoted to the pandemic. Ministers highlighted efforts to promote international trade cooperation while minimizing impacts of COVID-19 though “a coordinated global response.”

A UNCTAD reportoutlined ways to facilitate trade in areas related to process optimization, cost reduction, transparency and cooperation enhancement, and full use of technology to ensure cross-border trade continues while reducing face-to-face interaction.

Another UNCTAD reportdiscussed how South-South cooperation can help build solidarity to weather the interconnected economic and public health crises.

UNCTAD and the five UN regional commissions launched a projectto help governments and businesses keep transport networks and borders operational and facilitate the flow of goods and services, while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.

The International Trade Centre (ITC) released a 15-point action planto support micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Representatives from the UN and its Member States considered actionsto mitigate the potential socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on food availability and supply, and to attain food security.

A webinarconvened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s (IISD) Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) addressed trade and climate change in the context of COVID-19, showcasing examples of national responses and policies being implemented.

A webinar convened by IISD addressed the interlinkages between trade, public health, and intellectual property rights, especially given the COVID-19 resolution negotiated and adopted for the 73rd World Health Assembly.

Engagement with China included an EU-China summit on 22 June where European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, drew attention to “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between China and the EU.

Selection Process for Next WTO Director-General

Amid efforts to bring about the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he will step down on 31 August 2020, cutting his second term short by one year. The selection process for the next Director-General normally spans six months, but following a 10 July announcement by WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), the process has been shortened, with the third and final phase now scheduled to begin on 7 September.

Eight WTO Members (Egypt, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the UK) submitted nominations for the post of WTO Director-General to succeed Azevêdo. Following the closure of the nomination period on 8 July, candidates are meeting with WTO members at a special General Council meeting from 15-17 July to present their views and take questions from the membership. They will then have the remainder of July and all of August to continue making their case for the role.

They also described approaches to transformative change for the forests-food-energy-climate nexus and their potential and limitations, emphasizing equity, gender, and governance.

The event illustrated the potential for synergies among SDGs that focus on sustainable land and resource use. It emphasized policy and regulatory environments and capacities that support and incentivize sustainable forest-related livelihoods and development.



The event was organized by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, and Natural Resources Institute Finland. It sought to build on work undertaken by IUFRO’s Special Project on World Forests, Society and Environment (WFSE), and the recent publication Sustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People .



Speakers highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the appreciation for forests and the recognition of the need to preserve natural habitats. Forest-based transformation pathways were discussed as a means to restore sustainable land use systems, freshwater use, ecosystem functions such as climate mitigation, and biodiversity restoration. Forests were also highlighted for their contributions to: preventing zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 by ensuring the balance between pathogens and host species is restored; recognizing the contribution of indigenous peoples and local communities; forest conversion moratoria; and agroforestry.



Panelists also emphasized:

COVID-19 has exposed gender inequalities in several areas including jobs, and caused a spike in gender violence;

the importance of gender equality for sustainability and for enabling the forest sector to contribute to the SDGs; and

pathways to build and strengthen synergies among SDGs related to sustainable production, reduced use of traditional wood fuels, and improved resource efficiency.

The event took place on 9 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ENB Coverage of the Side Event]","During a virtual side event, held on the sidelines of the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants discussed the role of forests and forestry in accelerating transformative pathways to sustainable development.
They also described approaches to transformative change for the forests-food-energy-climate nexus and their potential and limitations, emphasizing equity, gender, and governance.
The event illustrated the potential for synergies among SDGs that focus on sustainable land and resource use.
It sought to build on work undertaken by IUFRO’s Special Project on World Forests, Society and Environment (WFSE), and the recent publication Sustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People .

The website details information in two lists, based on EU regulations for REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR), Plant Protection Products Regulation (PPPR), and cosmetic products. A third hazard-based list (List III) details substances proposed by an individual National Authority with possible endocrine disrupting properties.

More specifically, List I includes substances that have undergone an evaluation of endocrine disrupting properties and which are identified as endocrine disruptors at the EU level. List II contains substances currently under evaluation in an EU legislative process due to concerns for possible endocrine disrupting properties, or as part of the mandatory process for approval or renewal.



List III contains substances, proposed by an individual National Authority and considered endocrine disruptors at the national level in one of the participating countries. These substances are not necessarily supported by other Member States or considered endocrine disruptors at the EU level. The European Commission (EC) or Member States may decide at a later stage to further evaluate these substances.



If a substance is deleted or its status changes following an EU-investigation, Lists I and II will be updated during the next periodic update of the website. If scientific information on endocrine disrupting properties of a List III substance changes, the substance’s status will be updated by the National Authority that initially included the substance. A record of substances no longer on a list will remain accessible from the website. The lists are updated at least biannually.

More than 40 pieces of legislation are involved in regulating chemicals in the EU. For example, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) is responsible for REACH, which regulates industrial chemicals produced in or imported into the EU.

The European Food Safety Authority is responsible for pesticide regulation, which regulates active substances used in plant protection products to protect crops against pests or weeds, primarily in agriculture.

ECHA is also responsible for regulating biocidal products, which are used to protect humans, animals and manufactured materials against harmful organisms (pests, bacteria, algae, viruses) via the active substance contained in the product.","Five EU Member States are collaborating on a website to inform stakeholders about the status of substances identified as endocrine disruptors or under evaluation for endocrine disrupting properties within the EU.National Authorities in Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Sweden are compiling information to improve knowledge about endocrine disruptors and increase transparency, coherence, consistency, and coordination across legislative areas.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development specifies, in paragraph 79, that Member States should “conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels, which are country-led and country-driven.” These reviews are supposed to draw on contributions from Indigenous peoples, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, “in line with national circumstances, policies and priorities.” National parliaments and other institutions “can also support these processes.”

The 2030 Agenda also indicates, in paragraph 84, that when the HLPF is meeting under the auspices of ECOSOC, it shall carry out regular reviews that are voluntary and state-led, involving ministerial and other relevant high-level participants, and involve developed and developing countries. The reviews are also to “provide a platform for partnerships, including through the participation of major groups and other relevant stakeholders.”

AstraZeneca, Deloitte and BP are among a cohort big-name businesses to have jointly unveiled £500,000 of grant funding for young innovators working on projects driving progress towards the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Coordinated through the One Young World platform, the funding will be complemented with mentorship sessions between the businesses and the entrepreneurs. It is hoped that, for every £1 invested through the scheme, £15 of social value will be delivered.

In order to receive funding, each project had to prove how it is driving progress towards one of the Global Goals, across the entire scope of its aims and targets. The initiative was open globally and has named winners from Asia, Africa, Canada, Central America and Latin America, as below:

The SDG 2: Zero Hunger prize was awarded to Canada-based Tailored, a startup producing plant-based, culturally relevant food products at price points accessible to families facing poverty. Reckitt Benckiser, the parent firm of brands including Air Wick, Nurofen and Lysoll, is supporting this category.

The SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing prize went to Colombia-based BIVE. BIVE’s BR13 initiative provides best-practice advice and leadership tools centred on issues such as non-communicable diseases, mental health and sexual health in a digital format. It is specifically tailored for young people living in rural areas without rapid access to quality, affordable healthcare. AstraZeneca is supporting this category and will also allocate funding to Create Purpose, a Mexican organisation promoting non-communicable disease prevention for orphans and other vulnerable children.

The SDG 4: Quality Education category winner is CAYSTI, a Cameroonian initiative boosting access to STEM and arts education in rural locations using tech-based solutions. Deloitte is the category sponsor.

The SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation prize was awarded to Ekogroup H2O+. This Colombian project is driving behaviour change around rainwater harvesting in the country’s urban areas and will receive support from Reckitt Benckiser.

The SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy funding has been awarded to Climatenza, an initiative accelerating the deployment of solar thermal technology across India’s business sphere. This category is sponsored by BP, which recently invested $200m in solar developer Lightsource.

The SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure category winner is Nepal-based fintech social enterprise Aeloi. Aeoli specialises in tracing climate impact finance and will receive support from Standard Chartered Bank.

The SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities prize went to Blend Edu, a startup working to promote diversity and inclusivity in Brazilian businesses through educational experience. The category sponsor here is Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).

The SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production winner, backed by Mondi Group,is Canadian biotech firm Genecis. Genecis takes low-value organic waste streams and turns them into materials which can be used to replace single-use plastics.

The SDG 13: Climate Action category was specifically open to entrants from the sustainable agriculture space, given that agriculture is a key driver of both emission and nature loss. The winner is Xillinat, a Mexican natural substitute for sugar and sweeteners which requires less land, water and pesticides to produce and is suitable for diabetics. Asahi will support Xillinat.

The SDG 14: Life Below Water funding is being provided by Credit Suisse to repurpose, an Indian social enterprise helping businesses achieve plastic neutrality. Credit Suisse is notably The World Bank’s partner on its sustainable water bond, and, in 2019, aligned its strategy with the SDGs.

edie’s content editor Matt Mace last year attended One Young World’s London Summit to garner insight from global companies including Unilever, Virgin and BP, as well as thought leaders like Dr Jane Goodall and Mary Robinson. You can read his coverage of the event here.

Decade of deliverance

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”. Previous backers of the initiative, which is called Lead2030 and has been running since 2018, include KPMG and Porter Novelli.

The announcement of this year’s prize winners comes shortly after UN Global Compact published the results of a survey conducted among representatives from the sustainability teams or C-suite of 615 businesses. Of the respondents, less than one-third said their sector is moving rapidly enough to deliver adequate progress against the SDGs which it should be framing as a priority and just 39% believe that the SDG-related targets set by their own business are ambitious enough.

UNGC argued that while many businesses may feel that social and economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis will hamper their sustainable development progress, they must ultimately seize the moment to increase their ambition, given that the pandemic has highlighted social and environmental issues and could ultimately exacerbate them.

The platform's standard and artificial-intelligence driven data enables investors to assess companies on their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The product will be available via distribution partner Qontigo.

Solving data challenges

Global investors increasingly consider the SDGs relevant to their investment strategy, policy, asset allocation, investment decisions and active ownership, according to research by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). However, a lack of quality data to identify contributions to the SDGs has been an impediment for investors, and companies struggle to adapt their disclosures to meet investor needs. By providing a globally consistent SDG measurement framework, the SDI Asset Owner Platform helps investors to imbed the SDGs into their investment processes.

Shared understanding of Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs)

The SDI AOP allows asset owners and their managers to connect around the shared objective of measuring and understanding their portfolio investments' contributions to the SDGs. These goals, set by the United Nations in 2015, aim for a better, more prosperous world, by addressing urgent global issues such as water scarcity, healthcare access, and protecting the environment. Investments in companies whose products or services contribute to the realization of the SDGs are called Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs).

AI-driven actionable insights

The SDI Asset Owner Platform provides a common definition, taxonomy, and data source for investments into the SDGs. Powered by AI-technology, data science company Entis generates SDI classifications for 8,000 companies to date. This enables investors to assess their global capital markets' portfolios on their contribution to the SDGs and to report to their clients and external stakeholders transparently and consistently, using a common and auditable standard. The SDI classifications will be commercially available through Qontigo. The SDI definition and taxonomy are public and equally applicable to private market investments.

Asset-owner led platform

The SDI AOP is asset owner-led and asset owners make all methodological choices. The platform builds on the direct input and feedback from asset owners and their managers, and feeds the participating asset owners' policy and investment needs into the assessment process. Subscribers and other stakeholders will also be invited to provide feedback. The SDI Asset Owner Platform will host a virtual event in September to provide interested investors with additional insight into the workings of the platform.

Commitment to the SDGs

The participating asset owners believe it is essential to invest into the SDGs, and to do so at scale. In September 2019, APG and PGGM, at the behest of their pension fund clients ABP, bpfBOUW and PFZW, announced their cooperation to set up the SDI Asset Owner Platform. These pension funds, among them the two largest in the Netherlands, have set ambitious targets for investing in the SDGs. AustralianSuper and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) have since joined the platform. The SDI AOP welcomes investors across the globe to subscribe, creating a critical mass of investors who together define the meaning of investing in the SDGs.

Claudia Kruse, Managing Director Global Responsible Investment & Governance, APG

""The SDGs are global and launching this standard with asset owners from three continents shows our commitment to contribute to the SDGs, and we look forward to extending the collaboration. SDGs and AI-based technology are at the forefront of innovation. This investment is part of our commitment to our clients on whose behalf we invest in order to provide affordable pension in a sustainable world.""

Andrew Gray, Director ESG and Stewardship, AustralianSuper

""As a founding member of the SDI AOP, AustralianSuper strongly welcomes the opportunity to jointly establish a global standard for investors to identify sustainable development investments. The platform will progress how we assess and engage with investee companies on their SDG contribution, measurement and reporting. This will promote real world sustainable outcomes which are vital for creating long-term value for beneficiaries.""

Jennifer Coulson, Vice President ESG, BCI

""Standardization of data is one of the biggest challenges facing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) landscape. For this reason, we are excited to be part of this asset-owner led initiative which sets a global standard on SDG contributions for all investors and brings consistency and comparability to company-level data. This is the type of quality data that BCI relies on when making investment decisions that are required to generate value-added returns for our clients.""

Eloy Lindeijer, Chief Investment Management, PGGM

""For PGGM this platform is an important next step in a process to mobilize ever more institutional capital around the big challenges of our time, as described in the SDGs. By collaborating with asset owners from different continents we hope that this SDI AOP will contribute to being a global standard for investors.''

Sebastian Ceria, Chief Executive Officer, Qontigo

""The application of transparent rules-based methodologies, common definitions, taxonomies and strong data are the bedrock elements required for effective sustainable investing. We are proud to be a part of the SDI Asset Owner Platform's efforts to enhance the ability of investors to achieve their commendable goals in sustainable investing.""

Wim Scheper, Managing Director, Entis

""Contributing to the development of a global standard for SDG investments is truly inspiring. It will guide the decision-making by investors and companies towards a more sustainable world.""

During these sessions, the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) Replenishment Task Force on the replenishment of the Multilateral Fund (MLF) presented its report to the parties.

As the Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the unusual OEWG notes, it was crucial that the Working Group prepare the way for the negotiation of the decisions to be adopted by the joint session of 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 12) to the Vienna Convention and 23rd Meeting of the Parties (MOP 23), which are tentatively scheduled for November 2020. In November, delegates will negotiate decisions related to funding that will support parties in phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The “MLF replenishment is a ‘do or die’ item for the Protocol as the current round of funding ends in December 2020.”

During the online sessions, the ENB summary reports that Replenishment Task Force Co-Chairs Bella Maranion, Suely Carvalho and Shiqui Zhang presented an overview of the report, stating that the MLF Replenishment needs to take into account not only the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) phase-out but also the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phase-down. Estimated funding requirements put forward by the RTF ranged from USD 376,697,000 to USD 808,706,000.

Issues raised by parties during the discussions included:

creating centers of excellence for those countries whose consumption of ozone-depleting substances classifies them as low-volume-consuming countries to aid in capacity building;

considering the potential impact of COVID-19 on preserving the ozone infrastructure and implementation of future activities; and

insufficient funding for institutional strengthening.

The online forum will reopen from 17-31 July 2020, providing parties with another opportunity to submit comments and questions on the report that have not yet been addressed. The OEWG 42 Co-Chairs will then compile and share these submissions with all parties.

The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

The two Dutch funds set out in September last year their intention to establish the platform which allows asset owners and their managers to connect around the shared objective of measuring and understanding their investments’ contributions to the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Now British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and AustralianSuper have joined the Dutch funds to jointly established the Sustainable Development Investments Asset Owner Platform (SDI AOP).

Claudia Kruse, the managing director of global responsible investment and governance at APG, said in an interview that the platform uses the definitions and taxonomy defined by the asset owners, which feeds into Entis, the technology platform, which turns those rules and methodology into classifications for 8,000 companies. The standard in the underlying data gets distributed by Qontigo and will be available for asset owners to use, like other data services.

“The benefit for asset owners is they are aligned with others with a standard definition. Asset owners can integrate this data across all investment processes – quantitative and fundamental – and monitor, map and steer their portfolios.”

Kruse said investors can also use the data to monitor external managers, and for asset allocation.

“This is a data source and a standard that truly aligns with the SDGs, based on financial data rather than sustainability data – and is auditable,” she said.

Rather than measure a corporate’s conduct or progress on sustainability, the platform looks through a different lens. It rates companies on the extent to which their core business activity helps create, for example, sustainable cities (SDG 11) or generate clean energy (SDG 7) in a novel approach that brings a new level to standardisation and efficiency to SDG portfolio management.

“Our definition is not based on company conduct such as an energy efficient oil refinery, but the products and services that contribute to SDGs. So we have to look at a company’s core business and how it is composed, what parts of the business contribute to the SDGs. One good example is Acardis which we have been engaging with on disclosures, they report on products and services that contribute to SDGs,” Kruse said.

“Some companies are very straight forward, such as in renewable energy, but there are others for example in the pharma or consumer goods sectors that you need to get the contextual information to understand the products and services and what contributions to the SDGs they make. This is why AI is so important because it can process vast amounts of data and patterns.”

APG has set target of 20 per cent of its AUM to be aligned to the SDGs by 2025 and Kruse said that sustainable development investments also have to meet risk/return requirements and there are no concessions made for that.

“The data can help to inform such requirements,” she said.

Going forward Kruse said the intention is to have a stronger emphasis on forward-looking metrics to get insight into how well positioned a portfolio company is for the future.

“We don’t call ourselves an impact investor even though we want to make positive contributions. Measuring “outcomes” is more descriptive.”

The AI SDG platform will be broadly available in the market and a virtual event on September 10 will provide interested investors with additional insight into the workings of the platform.

“This is not open source because we have put substantial resources towards it. Our goal to define a standard to contribute to and invest in the SDGs.”","Investors in Canada and Australia have joined the Dutch funds, APG and PGGM, in making their intention of an AI-driven SDG investment platform a reality.
Now British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and AustralianSuper have joined the Dutch funds to jointly established the Sustainable Development Investments Asset Owner Platform (SDI AOP).
The standard in the underlying data gets distributed by Qontigo and will be available for asset owners to use, like other data services.

The report titled, ‘WTO Contribution to the 2020 HLPF,’ highlights that the multilateral trading system has contributed to “unprecedented economic development” over the last few decades, and observes that increased certainty over trade policies has resulted in predictability and created the conditions for long-term business planning and investment. The report underscores the role of trade, fiscal, and monetary policies in achieving the SDGs and supporting sustainable development. For example, the report highlights discussions with the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment on domestic initiatives on waste and chemicals management and recycling and on how trade policy can support the circular economy. In addition, the Aid for Trade initiative contributes to SDG target 8a (increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs)), and gender-responsive trade policies contribute to increasing women’s participation in global trade (in line with SDG 5) while contributing to economic growth (in line with SDG 8).

The report provides a review of the WTO’s efforts on SDG 14.6 on prohibiting fisheries subsides that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and on SDG 17.10 on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system. The report states that discussions on reducing harmful fisheries subsidies are playing a critical role in advancing developing countries’ sustainable development objectives.

The report recommends that governments mainstream trade into their national development plans, including by defining a clear national trade policy, ensuring effective institutional coordination, and integrating trade into sector strategies. To support progress on SDG 17.11 (doubling LDCs’ share in global trade by 2020), the report emphasizes the need for measures that address challenges faced by LDCs in international trade to ensure a more equitable distribution of trade benefits.

The report also considers the potential impact of COVID-19 on global trade, and shares steps taken by WTO members to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reflects that the COVID-19 crisis has had a “major impact” on global supply and demand, resulting in disruptions of global supply chains for goods and services, and concludes that expectations of recovery in the value of world trade “will need to be revised downwards.” The report welcomes the introduction of fiscal and monetary measures by governments to prevent social lockdowns from creating large-scale business failure and job losses. The WTO emphasizes the importance of maintaining open trade and investment flows to protect jobs, reduce disruptions in global supply chains, and ensure that products are available for all.

The UN has warned in its recently released State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 report that achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger might not be possible by 2030. The report estimates 690 million people suffering from hunger globally in 2019, 10 million more than the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic, and the global recession caused by it, will without doubt make matters worse, the report warns, with 130 million more suffering from chronic hunger in 2020. In 2019, Asia had the highest number of hungry people (381 million), followed by Africa (250 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030. The lowest-cost healthy diet is estimated to cost, on an average, more than $1.90—which is more than the international poverty threshold—and around three billion people across the globe are unable to afford this. Rising food deprivation will exacerbate the existing problem of nutrition security.

The largest impact, both for the present as well as the future, will be of hunger amongst children—191 million children under the age of five are currently undernourished. While India saw under-5 undernutrition decline by around 60 million over the last one and a half decade, from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19, and stunting has also come down, experts fear the pandemic could erode some of this progress. The UN has pitched for clubbing direct cash transfers with in-kind transfers to ensure food security and diet diversity, though, in India’s case, it talks of the inefficiencies of the PDS and calls for reducing subsidies and redirecting these to direct cash transfer. Malnutrition, as estimated by FAO earlier, may cost nations 4-5% of their GDPs. Given how ensuring food security gets more urgent in the post-Covid-19 world, India needs to shift comprehensively to cash support, so that the vulnerable don’t fall through gaps—thanks to poor implementation, the bulk of beneficiaries of the free-grains announced under the corona relief package by the Union government were unable to receive these in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030.

The report, published by Jordan Kelly-Linden under the title “COVID-19 dries up hopes of ending global water poverty by 2030, campaigners warn”, sheds light on the increasing water insecurity under the pandemic, rendering the sustainable development goal (SDG) of the UN to deliver safe water and sanitation for all by 2030 off track.

The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

The outbreak requires proper water and sanitation, and washing hands to maintain hygiene, according to the report, which adds that “more than 297,000 children less than five years die due to diarrhoea linked to inadequate wash facilities every year”.

""Poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid,"" the report adds.

""The water sector in Jordan has been able to provide water for all since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, especially potable, clean and safe water that matches the highest international standards,"" Assistant Secretary General and Spokesperson at the Water Ministry Omar Salameh told The Jordan Times on Monday.

Jordan has been working on securing water for all as per the UN’s SDG 6 on water and sanitation for all, Salameh said, noting that work focused on sustainable provision of water to citizens and refugees.

Salameh also said that the water sector has dealt with sanitation water through proper management and using sterilisation to prevent the transmission of the virus.

The ministry has also been working on utilising rainfall through expanding the capacity of dams, he concluded.

The UN's SDG 6 aims to provide access to safe and affordable drinking water, universally and equitably, no later than 2030, the report says, quoting International coordinator at End Water Poverty Al Hassan Adam as saying: ""Yet with just a decade to go and COVID-19 only complicating the issue, these basic human rights are not being met.""","The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

The “new special topic” for the issue is market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies.

The report titled, ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020,’ compiles the main tariff parameters for each of the 164 WTO members, as well as other countries and customs territories where data are available. Each one-page tariff profile contains information on tariffs imposed by each economy on its imports, with disaggregation by sectors and duty ranges, and includes an analysis of the market access conditions each economy faces in its major export markets.

The publication features summary tariff and trade statistics for all countries and territories for all products, including a breakdown into agricultural and non-agricultural products, and information on non-tariff measures such as safeguards and anti-dumping measures, which, the report notes, “are of increasing importance in international trade.” Statistics for all countries and territories are presented in standardized tables, which, the report states, allows for easy comparisons between economies, between sectors, and, specifically for WTO members, between bound and applied tariffs.

The “special topic,” which presents a new subject in each edition, deals with market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies. The report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic “has highlighted the importance of easy access to affordable medical products” and that shortages of essential products and increased prices “have made it all the more challenging for countries to combat the crisis.” The relevant chapter discusses the bound and applied tariffs for medical products such as medicines and medical technology, critical for the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, the average tariff applied by WTO members to all medical products is 4.8%, with the highest tariffs (11.5% on average) being applied to personal protective products.

It was also the first day of work for Helen Thomson, who since that time has amassed more than 40 years of municipal experience in a career that began as an administrative assistant in the planning department.

“I feel very fortunate to have had such a long career at the County and I truly enjoyed my work,” Thomson said. “I have worked with many great Wardens, Councils and staff. The County has seen me through many of life’s milestones – getting married, having children and now grandchildren.”

Thomson said her decision to retire came with “mixed emotions” as she weighed her love of work along with her love of family.

“I discovered through the COVID shut down, I really enjoy being at home,” she said. “My office visitors were one-, two- and three-year-olds and a farmer who stopped for lunch. I have realized it is time.”

Thomson said she is looking forward to more time with her husband Don on their Martintown-area dairy farm. She and Don have three children, Drew, Kurtis and Kelsey, as well as five grandchildren, Brooke, Tristan, Scotlyn, Adelyn and Ashton. County CAO Tim Simpson congratulated Thomson on her decision and added a successor will have large shoes to fill.

“I have worked with many staff members over my own 30-year career in municipal government, and I can truly say that there is no one I have enjoyed working alongside more than Helen,” said Simpson. “Her loyalty to the County, professionalism, and work ethic are second to none. She has been my ‘go to’ colleague for almost 10 years and her retirement marks the end of an era in SDG.”

Warden Frank Prevost likewise congratulated Thomson on a most-deserving retirement.

“If I have a question, I know that Helen has the answer,” said Prevost. “On behalf of County Councils both past and present, I wish Helen all the best in her retirement and I know she will enjoy her time as a grandmother in the years to come.”

The County will begin work on a succession plan soon, with an update for County Council coming later this year.

The government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Prime Minister James Marape’s speech to the UN High-level political forum was delivered by National Planning Minister Sam Basil. It showcased the achievements and challenges of PNG. The conference was conducted at the APEC Haus early this morning via the United Nation’s website.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals range from Good Health and Well Being to Eliminating Poverty, Hunger and Climate Action.

Being a member of the United Nations, PNG adopted “Agenda 2030’ in the 70th session of the General Assembly in 2015.

This means PNG has agreed to measure its performances on development against the global benchmarks using indicators of the 17 SDGs.

In the first five SDGs, where it focuses on Ending Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well Being, Quality Education and Gender Equality, Prime Minister Marape says the population living below the extreme poverty line as per the last national survey has improved from 53 percent of the total population in 1996 to 39 percent in 2010.

The Prime Minister has noted improvement in health statistics that shows an increase in life expectancy rates but made mention that more focus needs to be given to health issues like TB and Malaria.

The other 12 SDGs include decent work and economic growth to responsible consumption and production.

In these different goals, the Prime Minister noted that the local economy has grown from an average of 6 percent between 2010 and 2014, highlighting a peak in 2013 at 13 percent before declining in 2015 to a 9.5 percent.","Share the NewsThe government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Gini coefficient for Bangladesh fluctuates around the trend line, but the overall trend is downward from 48.9 in 2000 to 31.5 in 2010 indicating declining income inequality. But a much clearer picture of income distribution emerges when one looks at the income distribution between the poorest 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent. The picture that emerges is: the income share of the poorest 10 per cent is 3.85 per cent compared to 26.92 per cent of the richest 10 per cent. In effect, the income share held by the highest 20 per cent is 41.48 per cent. An estimated 63 million people live under the poverty line in a country of 163 million people.

Bangladesh has also witnessed rapid urbanisation with more than a third of its population now living in urban areas. Although population growth rate has come down to 1.2 per cent per annum, the country remains one of the most densely populated in the world. This urbanisation has been spurred by structural changes in the rural economy resulting from the increased commercialisation of the agriculture sector and widespread rural poverty. But this rapid urbanisation has caused heightened urban poverty with extremely poor living conditions for these rural migrants and also urban congestion.

CLIMATE CHANGE, MIGRATION AND URBAN POVERTY: The genesis of migration lies in people's quest to live or subsist in a form better than their present status. Some migrate for sheer survival, that is, to escape from poverty; others, to improve their quality of life, while still others in search for fortune. Since each of these pursuits is made by people who come from different socio-economic strata and hence have a different purpose for moving, migration is quite a heterogeneous phenomenon. In contemporary low-income economies, however, the principal reason for people to move is the worsening productive-resource-to-human-power ratio, stemming mainly from rapid population growth and an external demand for local resources. This has compelled large sections of the populace to migrate to look for work as a part of their survival strategy. Depending upon the needs and circumstances, people move seasonally, for fixed periods, or permanently. In this sense, the transition economies of South-East Asia, some of which are among the poorer ones in the world, present a picture typical of other low-income countries.

SLUMISATION AND POOR URBAN SETTLEMENTS: The role of migration in urbanisation is obvious in all societies and at almost all times, since urbanisation and urban growth take place through a combination of three components, such as (a) natural increase of the native urban population, (b) area redefinition or reclassification or annexation, and (c) rural-urban (or other forms of internal) migration. In a condition of developing urbanisation, the role of migration is even more pronounced while in the state of advanced urbanisation, where urban growth is almost stagnant or even declining, internal migration plays a minor or almost no role. Rural to urban migration may again take many forms, such as (a) permanent migration, (b) temporary migration, (c) seasonal migration, (d) circular migration, and (c) commuting. The process ranges from short distance mobility (commuting) to long distance and long term movement or permanent migration. In the case of Bangladesh, the status of academic as well as planning studies on internal migration is not too bad, although, all dimensions of internal migration might not have received enough attention. Considerable literature exists on the subject of determinants or causes of rural to urban migration. A Bangladeshi scholar working at an American University has, in a recent paper, classified the models of migration into two groups (i) one which isolates migration as a domestic phenomenon and (ii) the other which places causes of migration within an international politico-economic framework. Migration is the combined effect of both push and pulls factors and it is often difficult to separate the role of the two. Within the Push-Pull model, push factors (at rural end) may be identified for Bangladesh as: 1) Population pressure, adverse person-land ratio, landlessness and poverty; 2) Frequent and severe natural disasters (particularly river bank erosion), and 3) Lack of economic opportunities.

The impact rural to urban migration is both diverse and deep, both at the urban destination end and at the rural origin. Most of the researches have been at the urban end. Urbanisation and urban growth occurring due to migration have both positive and negative consequences and impacts. Some of the positive consequences of urbanisation are the following: Economic benefits: higher productivity, better income etc; Demographic benefits: lowering of age at marriage, reduction of fertility rate; Socio-cultural benefits: modernisation; Political benefits: empowerment, democracy.

Urbanisation is not an unmixed blessing. Its negative consequences are of great concern. These assume critical role under situation of rapid and uncontrolled or unplanned urban expansion. The negative consequences can be grouped as the following: Environmental consequences-- encroachment on productive agricultural land and forests, extreme pressure on housing, growth of slums and the pressure on and urban services; Economic consequences-- income inequality and poverty, ill effects of globalisation; Social consequences-- increased violence and crime, social degradation; Cultural consequences-- entry of alien culture, loss of national cultural identity.

HIDDEN IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AMONG URBAN POOR: Climate change can directly affect health because high temperatures place an added stress on human physiology. Changes in temperatures and precipitation including extreme weather events and storms can cause deaths directly, or by altering the environment, result in an increased incidence of infectious diseases. Air pollution can be exacerbated by higher temperature and humidity. Finally, virtually all effects of global climate change ranging from sea-level rise to impacts on agriculture and human infrastructures are linked at least indirectly to human health.

The incidence and severity of many health problems increase with increasing temperature. As temperatures increase, the body expands added energy to keep cool. The most immediate consequence, if the body temperature rises above 410 C, is heat stroke. This disturbance to the temperature regulating mechanism may result in fever, hot and dry skin, rapid pulse and sometimes progress to delirium and coma. Also, temperature stress can exacerbate many existing health conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Mortality from such diseases, especially among children and the elderly, increases dramatically during periods of hot weather. Quantitative algorithms based on historical data that relate morbidity and mortality to weather conditions suggest that global warming will increase heart related mortality.

The combination of higher temperatures and potential increases in summer precipitation could create the conditions for greater intensity or spread of many infectious diseases. However, risk in the human health sector is low relative to climate change induced risks in other sectors (such as water resources) mainly because of the higher uncertainty about many of the health outcomes. Increased risk to human health from increased flooding and cyclones seems most likely. Changes in infectious disease are less certain. The causes of outbreaks of infectious disease are quite complex and often do not have a simple relationship with increasing temperature or change in precipitation. It is not clear if the magnitude of the change in health risks resulting from climate change will be significant compared to current risks. It is also not clear if increased health risk will be apparent in the next few decades. On the whole, climate change is expected to present increased risks to human health in Bangladesh, especially in the light of the poor state of the country's public health infrastructure.

In general, climate change impacts tend to be more on the poor than the rich. Inequality is not inevitable, it is a policy preference. Regarding sustainable urbanism, policymakers should improve urban efficiency in order to lower the cost of living by dealing with urban crowding and providing public goods, eliminate the causes that lead to squatter settlements, and not discourage internal migration, which fosters an efficient allocation of the population and has an equalising effect across places.

In McIntosh’s case, he is pursuing criminology at Carleton University in the fall. He would like to defend people in court who allege they’ve been wrongly accused. He’s attended, court sessions which also sparked his interest.

“My mom worked for lawyers, ever since I was a kid,” said McIntosh. “I’ve always been around it and it was something I’ve wanted to do ever since I was young.

“I chose Carleton because the program is best suited for what I want to do when I graduated.”

He looks forward to start studying for a career in law, with an aspiration to become an attorney. He also wants to enjoy living in Ottawa as he lived and worked on a family dairy farm his entire life. He notes living in a big city will be interesting as he lived in the country his entire life.

“More people is going to be the biggest thing,” said McIntosh. “More people and more noise in the city.”

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

The event convened on the sidelines of the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF), which took place virtually.

Plastic litter threatens the environment, human health, and business in marine and coastal settings. A spike in the use of single-use plastics due to the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this threat. Industry and the private sector play a crucial role in combating marine litter, with innovations on modes of production and consumption, waste management, and digital approaches.

Entrepreneurs and innovators are well positioned to develop new methods and technologies to deal with plastic PPE waste.

The side event titled, Engaging Industry through the Global Partnership on Marine Litter to deliver SDG 14, highlighted the need for more action on marine litter and provided examples on industry engagement. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told participants that, in 2015, only 9% of plastics was recycled, and damage from debris in the Asia-Pacific region totaled around USD 11 billion. She pointed to a resurgence in single-use plastic products with increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. To combat marine litter and plastic pollution, Andersen stressed the importance of: multilateralism and partnerships; engaging industry along the entire value chain; managing and recycling plastic waste from COVID-19; and reversing or halting production of single-use plastic products.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Norway’s Minister of International Development, said two billion people lack access to waste management. He noted Norway’s programme to reduce marine litter in developing countries and a multilateral trust fund for healthy oceans, to which Norway provided the initial contribution. Ulstein said the Nordic Ministers of Environment Climate produced a report on possible elements of a new global treaty on marine litter. He expressed hope that, during the fifth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5), countries would determine a path for such an agreement. He mentioned a forthcoming report from Norway on how industry can create a framework for healthy oceans.



Sabine Pahl, University of Plymouth, provided an overview of global actions to reduce the flow of marine plastic and microplastic to the ocean. She noted the voluntary reporting of 158 actions, 119 of which involve partnerships. She said an interactive dashboard and repository is under development to facilitate information sharing.



Simon Bennett, China Navigation Company (CNCo) and Swire Pacific Offshore Operations, described the Moana Taka Partnership, which CNCo established with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment (SPREP). The Partnership enables CNCo ships to carry recyclable waste from Pacific island ports, at no cost, to be sustainably treated and recycled in suitable ports in the Asia-Pacific region. He encouraged other shipping companies to adopt similar modalities, including in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions.



Susan Ruffo, Executive Director, Circulate Initiative, suggested engaging with entrepreneurs and innovators, who are well positioned to develop new methods and technologies to deal with PPE as a result of COVID-19.



Other speakers included representatives from:

WWF South Africa, who advocated for beginning negotiations on a legally binding treaty on plastic pollution;

the UNEP Cartagena Convention Secretariat, who stressed the need to fully engage industry and the private sector to achieve SDG 14;

IBM, who urged “thinking big, starting small and scaling fast,” using innovation and digital tools such as AI to provide guidance on preventing marine litter, and connecting stakeholders through a multi-sector collaboration platform; and

the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, who underscored the need to unlock more investment focused on infrastructure, innovation, education, and clean-up.

Wallace Cosgrow, Seychelles’ Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, and Co-Chair of the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), noted that because “the entire value chain of plastic is a transboundary issue,” on-the-ground work must merge to form a shared vision. He urged governments to achieve SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14, particularly those Goals’ targets related to reducing waste regeneration.

134,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/08/14/esg-and-sdg-alpha-backed-by-the-blockchain/,"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes,ESG And SDG Alpha Backed By The Blockchain,"ESG means Environmental, Social & Governance. SDG means Sustainable Development Goals. SDGs are set by the UN. Most SDGs have ESG implications. ESG rated companies have become popular in investment portfolios. This is because the ESG standing of a company is a proxy for long term value, say the boosters of ESG based investing. The retail investor, by necessity, outsources research on ESG to professionals and invests in funds with a sustainable focus. The funds are meant to investigate the sustainable claims of many companies. Instead of doing so themselves, they rely on outfits like MCSI and Sustainalytics to choose the portfolio companies.

Much like the ratings agencies whose triple A rated bonds cratered as the financial crisis hit in 2008, these ESG raters do not and cannot stand by their scores when non-sustainable practices at firms with high ratings are exposed. Similar to those rating agencies who also got paid by their targets to rate the bonds that they issued, there is often a conflict of interest at the heart of these ratings. The scores are often proprietary and employ models and methods, including survey based results which rely on the enterprises to self-report. Self-reporting has never been a good method to rate enterprises or individuals.

Sustainable Development Goals Graphic from the UN

After laying bare the debate about ESG based investment strategies; some efforts to improve the quality and depth of the data and hence make the scores more objective are discussed. Some of these proposals use the blockchain to secure the truths about the business attested by programmatic or other verifiable metrics. A combination of methods probably works best, with suspicious activity getting investigated further, including the use of shoe leather.

The Skeptics

The US Labor department regulators recently released a proposed new rule, to clarify the ERISA guidelines as being concerned purely with pecuniary results. The new rule says that ESG ratings should not be used as a criteria for investment. Since this affects all investments by pension plans, it has a great influence on investment strategy and climate in the US; since pension plans control a huge chunk of investment. This new rule could be a huge problem for portfolio managers who are in charge of pension funds.

Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it. A well respected analyst has asserted that ESG ratings do not have anything to do with the better performance of ESG rated companies; since the difference in performance during the pandemic is due to the fact that energy companies and airlines who have poor ESG ratings cratered in first weeks of the pandemic. You can certainly apply this narrow logic to the performance metrics focused on a specific crisis. However, nothing can be said about the wider alpha generated by better ESG metrics. Indeed the better performance of ESG companies during the pandemic can be thought of as being generated by their resilience, better credit ratings and being relatively sheltered from black swans like the pandemic.

One more example is a company called Boohoo in the UK. Boohoo had received good ESG ratings from the ESG rating agencies which earned it a place on some portfolios in ESG funds. When news broke that their supply chain included vendors that underpaid their workers, the stock dove. These revelations resulted in its removal from the ESG funds. This points to the lack of depth in the rating; for a fashion brand suppliers matter. This is a case of a company receiving higher grades than they should have, because of the lack of proper due diligence.

ESG Proponents

The head of State Street Advisors STT , Cyrus Taraporevala, published an op-ed in the Financial Times arguing against the dept of labor rule about the Erisa guidelines and its proscription of ESG ratings as criteria for investing. Taraporevala is all for the guidelines that put the fiduciary responsibility of the portfolio managers to focus on pecuniary results. However, his argument is that ESG forward companies are better suited to weather the storms since they focus on employee well-being, resilience of supply chains and agile management. This is more true in the longer horizon which most pension plans should be focused on. He asserts that stocks with higher ESG ratings are better bets in the long term. Taraporevala does admit that there are some gray areas in measurement and accounting for ESG risks.

Measuring ESG

There was some talk in the ESG community that using the SDGs to measure ESG performance would be better, since they are finer grained and may be actually measurable. There are 17 headings there rather than just three in ESG.

For carbon emissions and other types of environmentally destructive activities where there can be a measure of objectivity, independent auditors and public data can bridge the transparency gap. The IWA has created a Carbon Emissions Token that includes several measurements and assertions. Nominally this would be on the blockchain so that the various parties who issue and monitor the token can assert to the measurements.

Another effort in the climate & accounting SIG in Hyperledger to setup utility emission channels will use public eGrid data, published by the EPA, along with the customer’s utility bills to calculate the emissions attributable to their energy consumption can be used to rate enterprises on their emissions profile. This uses a blockchain to capture this information from multiple parties. All of this point to the original use case for the blockchain to be a non-repudiable source of ordered documents.

Other ESG factors are harder to measure, especially the social and governance aspects. The ESG rating agencies who use a host of factors to calculate the ESG ratings will have to use many more automated methods using publicly available data; including some from blockchain anchored data stores. These methods will get better as time passes and ESG ratings will no longer be questioned as proxies for long term performance.","Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it.

The note draws on the expertise of environment and trade experts to identify investment and trade solutions to tackle cross-border challenges and move towards a sustainable circular plastics economy.

The note titled, ‘Plastics, the Circular Economy and Global Trade,’ states that the world produces over 400 million tonnes of plastics annually, much of which is “mismanaged after use… causing damage to environment and societies.” Only 14-18% of plastic waste is formally recycled, and a large percentage of plastic waste intended for recycling is exported. Within this context, the note explores ways to enable legitimate, responsible trade to establish recycling economies of scale.

The note identifies four types of cross-border challenges in scaling a global, circular plastics economy, related to: regulations, such as bans or requirements on plastic waste imports; standards and data; investment; and processes. Differences among countries in each of these areas contributes to challenges in moving towards a more circular economy. Differences in standards on labeling and use, for instance, require recyclers to create different recycled plastic grades, which adds to the overall cost. On processes, the note states that the Basel Convention will regulate most plastic waste trade across borders through a prior informed consent (PIC) procedure, beginning in 2021.

Meaningfully scaling the circular economy for plastics requires systemic change beyond the areas of waste management and recycling.

The note also observes that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for single-use plastics for personal protective equipment. In addition, online grocery orders and restaurant takeways have contributed to an increase in disposable packaging, and limited recycling capacities during the pandemic have negatively impacted recycling operations. Some governments have “rolled back bans on single-use plastics” to keep infection rates low, and others have suspended or delayed bans on the use of plastic bags. Despite these challenges, the note emphasizes the need for long-term actions to tackle the plastic pollution problem.

The paper proposes three groups of trade policy actions to scale the shift towards a more circular global plastics economy: border measures; internal mechanisms; and increased transparency. Border measures include the Basel Convention, harmonized system classifications, tariff cuts, export bans, trade facilitation, and efforts to tackle illicit trade. Internal measures include recycling services, investment facilitation, technical assistance, and international standards. Policies to promote transparency include domestic regulation notifications, best practice sharing, and data monitoring systems. The paper further recommends refining the international classification system for traded goods to distinguish between different types of plastic, arguing that such distinction would help countries use trade incentives accurately and facilitate more precise data collection. The note concludes that scaling the circular economy for plastics requires “systemic change beyond the areas of waste management and recycling,” and calls for taking a holistic approach to managing plastics through reducing, reusing, and recycling plastics.

UN Member States agreed in June 2019 that the UN’s 75th anniversary will be commemorated under the theme, ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’ In a letter of 8 August 2020, Volkan Bozkir said that given the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global crisis, he suggests a more specific theme for the General Debate, as follows: ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.’

Bozkir adds that the debate should focus in particular on the most vulnerable, as well as on ensuring efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda “adapt to the crisis,” noting the outset of the Decade of Action for the SDGs.

By this text, the UNGA’s high-level meeting to commemorate UN’s 75th anniversary will convene on 21 September. It will formally adopt a declaration that has been negotiated by Member States in advance. Following negotiations, a silence procedure concluded without objection on 7 July, and UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande informed Member States that “consensus has been achieved and the text has been finalized.”

The decision indicates that the Summit on Biodiversity will take place on 30 September, the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) on 1 October, and the high-level meeting on the total elimination of nuclear weapons on 2 October. For all of these meetings, the decision authorizes pre-recorded video statements. The video statements “shall have an equal status as any statement made by any other representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall” and shall be included in the verbatim records of the Debate or meeting.

The decision also encourages Member States to hold all side events on virtual platforms to limit the number of people in the UN building.

Immediately prior to the high-level week, the UN will hold the first annual ‘SDG Moment’ on Friday, 18 September. Details are under discussion.","The president-elect of the 75th UN General Assembly has announced the theme for the general debate, which will open on 22 September 2020.

139,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wto-goods-trade-barometer-indicates-historic-fall-hints-at-recovery/,"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WTO Goods Trade Barometer Indicates Historic Fall, Hints at Recovery","The World Trade Organization (WTO) published its latest quarterly Goods Trade Barometer reading on 19 August 2020. The release shows a continued drop in goods trade associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but hints at the early beginnings of stabilization.

The WTO publishes two sets of indicators, each launched in September 2019. The Goods Trade Barometer (formerly the World Trade Outlook Indicator) shows how the latest data points compare to short-term trends in goods trade, providing an indication of potential trajectory in the near future based on a variety of component indices that are combined into a single composite index. The Services Trade Barometer combines six component indices into a composite index to illustrate the current state of services prior to the release of official statistics. Each is intended to complement traditional trade statistics and forecasts.

An L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, recovery trajectory cannot be ruled out.

Each barometer is normalized for medium-term trends, with a score of 100 indicating growth in line with medium-term trends. Scores that exceed 100 indicate above-trend growth, and those below 100 show below-trend growth. Scores that deviate by more than 5 points are considered substantially above or below trend.

A WTO release notes that the latest Goods Trade Barometer’s composite score of 84.5 is 15.5 points below the baseline value of 100 for the index and down 18.6 points year-on-year. This scoring is generally consistent with the WTO’s June statistics, which imply a 14% drop in global trade volume between the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. While nearly all drivers of goods trade considered (export orders, automotive products, container shipping, air freight, electronic components, and raw materials) have declined, the WTO suggests that the indices “have held up relatively well” and that world trade in 2020 may be evolving in line with the less pessimistic scenario outlined in an April forecast. The release cautions however, that a “V-shaped” recovery is uncertain, and emphasizes the possibility of an “L-shaped” pathway where global trade levels out “well below its pre-pandemic trajectory.”

A methodology document notes that the Trade Goods Barometer is published quarterly, whereas the Services Trade Barometer is updated twice per year.

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);

SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); and

SDG target 16.1 (violence), including homicide rates per 100,000, broken down by sex.

141,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/pandemic-lessons-open-data-for-forest-and-climate-action/,"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Pandemic Lessons: Open Data for Forest and Climate Action,"Since March 2020, we have witnessed numerous parallels between COVID-19 and the climate crisis, including a lack of cohesive, coordinated global intervention and a laissez-faire response to a global emergency.

Inadequate government response to the pandemic has led to preventable deaths from a highly contagious virus, just as inadequate government responses to the climate crisis could result in exacerbated effects by drought, fires or flooding as well as rising food insecurity. These risks are fast approaching their tipping points.

COVID-19 has inundated our lives with numbers and social media updates to the point of statistical overload, a phenomenon WHO refers to as an ‘infodemic.’ The flood of information has occasionally caused the public to question the veracity of certain claims, which in turn has hampered effective public health responses. Nonetheless, the vast availability of data encourages scientists and citizen scientists across the world to disseminate models, ideas and scenarios for better progress against the virus.

Open Data for Forests

The pandemic reinforces the importance of data for interpretation and dissemination. It is a resource that needs to be carefully curated, because leaders, whether in health or in climate science, need to make informed decisions in order to respond to global agendas such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Likewise, citizens will need assurance and transparency to act as individuals and communities, and to advocate for data-driven policy development.

Likewise, forest data transparency is key to supporting higher levels of ambition for the roles of forests in climate change action. Progress in National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMS) in the past ten years has catalyzed solutions for forests and climate action, such as for REDD+. In many countries, greater transparency of countries’ forest-sector data and information has resulted in improved national decision-making, and for the first time, detailed and transparent forest data has been reported internationally, with 50 countries having submitted forest reference emissions levels to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Still, countries’ efforts towards forest data transparency must be strengthened. Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement, robust data collection is central for reporting on emissions and removals, as well as for tracking the progress of Nationally Determined Contributions. An NFMS that is transparent, reliable, relevant, accessible, and sustainable can support climate action on the ground.

What lessons can forest monitoring practitioners take from the ongoing pandemic?

Sharing openly can flatten the curve: With COVID-19, countries that have embraced data acquisition through frequent testing and have been transparent about infection rates have mostly succeeded in flattening the curve of infections. In Germany, testing, tracing, and transparency are credited with building public trust. Likewise, improved data availability combined with transparency could catalyze more collaborative solutions to the climate crisis that could equally buy some precious time to achieve the terms of the Paris Agreement. Climate policies need up-to-date and integrated information: Data sets can be shared at unprecedented speed. While the availability of COVID-19 related data has often overwhelmed data consumers and resulted in conflicting guidance, frequent and integrated forest data is likely to enhance public engagement and collaboration on relevant solutions for forests. Public money means public information: Enormous financial resources have been poured into COVID-19 monitoring. Likewise, national forest data is primarily collected through taxpayer finances, either through national or international cooperation funds. Greater public financing of large-scale data collection and sharing ultimately means greater information available to the public, enhancing public trust and increasing opportunities for investors and researchers. Open, transparent, and reliable forest data can also enhance private investment, which is urgently needed to trigger transformation of forest and land management for climate action and other multiple benefits. Accurate and reliable forest data created from public funds needs to be open and accessible to the public. Overcoming obstacles to sharing: Under the pandemic, open data has accelerated science, but also introduced vulnerabilities. Both media and politicians have sometimes reported promising results before they have been scientifically validated. Among the obstacles to sharing forest data is the concern of inadequate use of the data and lack of intellectual property recognition. Barely 14% of researchers in 2018 shared their data in repositories. Yet, twisting the tragedy of the commons, while 74% researchers value others’ data sharing as beneficial to their own research, both scientists and governments show reluctance to share their own data.

To overcome this resistance, legal agreements that release individual contributors from conflicts with the institutions involved in data sharing are needed, with updated and harmonized measures to ensure anonymity of legal subjects and/or spatial coordinates. Further, data ownership recognition standards should encourage data sharing. Government officials and researchers need to follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guiding principles for data management and stewardship, thereby making the case that in the end the benefits of sharing outweigh the disadvantages.

Forest Open Data Platforms and FAO’s Support

Some existing microdata platforms, such as the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative GFBI, largely compile and share global field data for academic research and require strict rules on confidentiality and control of users. Yet, forest-related information still remains largely scattered across multiple platforms. FAO is working with UN Member States to overcome obstacles to open forest data. Our current efforts include:

the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, which provides country validated forest data, accessible through an interactive platform and dashboards.

the Hand-in-Hand geospatial platform launched recently, representing a major step towards accessible and transparent cross-sectoral geospatial data across agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.

a set of free and open source tools (Open Foris) developed by FAO to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting helping to enhance forest monitoring at national level.

A new FAO project ‘Building global capacity to increase transparency in the forest sector (CBIT-Forest)’ to establish a Global Field Forest Observation Repository with a view to harmonizing legal assurances in data confidentiality, redistribution policies, and quality assurance conditions meeting international data documentation protocols. Microdata inclusion on this platform would contribute to increased standardization, accessibility and data usage.

A New, Transparent Normal?

COVID-19 has increased awareness about the power of data sharing. We hope that this motivates governments and forest monitoring practitioners to share forest data. At the same time, it is important that open databases follow standards to minimize misuse and misinterpretation. We believe that open forest data can strengthen our collective effort to identify and apply solutions for forests as a key response to the climate emergency.

FAO’s support to forest monitoring aims to strengthen data openness standards, while solving conflicts with data protection and confidentiality. In order to achieve reusability, clear and accessible data use licenses must exist. Legal certainty through license to redistribute agreements, ensure data robustness alongside data sensitivity. A Global Field Forest Observation Repository to facilitate data sharing of forest microdata to technicians and academics while supporting international reporting requirements across countries, is a step towards fostering that necessary transparency.

The Angels wrapped up the tournament with a 3-1 record after losing in a semifinal game.

Finishing with a 12-5 overall record, the 13U Angels reached the semifinals in all four of the Grand Slam Baseball tournaments they entered.

SDG (Soli Deo Gloria, meaning Glory to God Alone) began its journey June 5-7 in the Back-to-Baseball Blowout held at Signature Park in Braselton. In heartbreaking fashion, the Angels lost 9-6 to the Lambert Longhorns — a team they defeated 9-3 in the qualifying round — in the championship game to finish second in a field of seven teams.

Not to be denied, the Angels next played in the 11-team June Jam Summer Series Week 3, held June 19-21 at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula. SDG beat the Orange Crush from Clemson, S.C., 11-9 in the Championship game to finish 4-1 in the tournament. Crowned Tournament Champions on Father’s Day, each Angel was presented with a championship ring.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

In a statement, the UWI said partners developed a three-day virtual programme which took place on August 15 and 22 and concludes on August 29, for adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago between the ages of 14 and 19.

This programme forms part of the UN’s 75th anniversary global dialogues on SDGs. It aims to introduce the participants to their roles in achieving SDGs and create a forum for helping them generate and present ideas for practical projects to improve their communities.

The Youth Awareness Programme commenced on August 15 with presentations on ‘Localising Sustainable Development Goals’. Students from The UWI, St Augustine campus and other educational institutions across the country participated and developed their own SDG projects in small groups via a virtual platform.

At the second session on August 22, the students presented their projects to a panel of representatives from the UN in Trinidad and Tobago, DEF and The UWI.

The UWI said a virtual awards ceremony is scheduled for the final day of the programme on August 29. The most innovative project proposal will be announced and funded by the UN for implementation.

Commenting on The UWI’s participation on the initiative, Dr Stacy Richards-Kennedy who heads the University’s regional Office of Global Partnerships and Sustainable Futures stated:

'Following our launch of the UWI SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign in 2017 and our ongoing SDG initiatives, we remain energised as a leading partner on programmes such as these. It is through continuous youth engagement and expansion of networks of youth advocates that we will be able to increase awareness and strengthen capacity to implement sustainable development projects. As a regional university, we remain committed to supporting the Caribbean in working towards the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.'

'The UWI’s involvement in this SDG Youth Awareness Programme is just one example of the University’s support for youth engagement on the global 2030 sustainable development agenda.'

The UWI said in 2017 it spearheaded a regional SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign funded by UNDP, co-organised the Caribbean Action 2030 Regional Conference and Youth Forum at its Mona Campus in Jamaica, launched a digital photo competition “Through the lens of Caribbean Youth” and produced a series of short films entitled “Youth Action on the SDGs” in collaboration with Sustain T&T.

In July this year, The UWI joined forces with UNICEF and the Ashley Lashley Foundation in Barbados to host the Global Youth Network Summit on Climate Change and Health, which included a Declaration signed by Caribbean students in support of climate action.

Several SDG youth engagement activities have also been led by The UWI Youth Development Programme and UWI-STAT Ambassadors. In 2020, The UWI also ranked among the top 200 universities in the Times Higher Education’s Impact Rankings for its research, outreach and stewardship of the SDGs.

The regional University’s partnership with Decibel Arts and Entertainment Festival was born earlier this year, based on DEF’s mission to work with youth and preparing them for the future. DEF has also stepped up to support UWI students across the region who have been functioning in difficult social circumstances because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this most recent collaboration, The UWI and DEF have realised another shared objective of empowering young people to make tangible contributions to help the region achieve the SDGs.

This commentary highlights some of the problems identified in the report and suggests possible solutions, which can bring more credibility and statistical acceptance to the future SDG index reports.

NITI Aayog launched the first edition of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index India Report in 2018 to measure India’s and its states’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030. It was meant to provide an aggregate assessment of performance of Indian states and union territories on social, economic and environmental parameters. Further, it was aimed to serve as a tool to benchmark progress, identify data issues, devise better policy strategies coupled with a sense of competitiveness among the states (NITI Aayog 2018). It was also one the first few attempts by a country to rank its subnational governments by using an index on SDGs (NITI Aayog 2019). The second edition of the report has been recently released. This is an enhanced version with 100 indicators covering 54 targets across 16 SDGs leaving SDG 17 as compared to the base version with 62 indicators covering 13 SDGs (leaving 12, 13, 14 and 17). This is a progressive sign with regard to larger coverage of goals, targets and indicators, and alignment with the National Indicator Framework (NIF), which serves as the backbone of SDG monitoring in the country (MoSPI 2019).

However, there is a need to critically analyse and relook at the methodology of SDG index and the policy implications it directs for the country.

In all, Ontario secured up to $4 billion in emergency assistance for municipalities through the Safe Restart Agreement, which gives them the support and flexibility they need to protect the health and well-being of their communities, while continuing to deliver critical public services as the province continues on the path of economic recovery.

“This new funding will provide municipalities with the support they need to protect the health and well-being of the people of Ontario, while continuing to deliver critical public services,” added McDonell.

In addition to the support for municipalities, the government is providing over $660 million in the first phase of transit funding to the 110 municipalities with transit systems. The funding can be used to provide immediate relief from transit pressures, such as lower ridership, as well as for new costs due to COVID-19, such as enhanced cleaning and masks for staff.

Cornwall will receive an additional $687,352 in order to support transit operations. It was reported by city officials on Monday that Cornwall Transit ridership was now at 30 per cent due to the pandemic.

In the second phase, additional allocations will be provided based on expenses incurred to ensure the funding meets the needs of municipalities. As part of the Safe Restart Agreement with the federal government, up to $2 billion is being provided to support public transit in Ontario.","The City of Cornwall, along with the five SDG Counties, will be receiving funding through a partnership between both the provincial and federal government.

The United Counties of SDG has agreed to fund a Cornwall Community Hospital (CCH) registered nurse to support the SDG detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police when it is apparent a mental health professional is required during a service call. The $120,000 funding arrangement, which covers a period of 12 months, complements the service agreement in place between the OPP and the hospital. County Council signed off on the funding agreement at its July meeting.

“This initiative is a great example of a partnership involving three local organizations to provide more resources to residents in need,” said Warden Frank Prevost. “County councillors fully support measures we can take that aid our police, and our residents, during situations that can be fraught with emotion.”

The CCH’s Mental Health Crisis Team (MHCT) and the SDG OPP entered into a partnership agreement to provide the SDG residents with the most appropriate community-based crisis response during calls for service.

“The purpose of this collaboration is to ensure that the residents of Stormont, Dundas, Glengarry have better health and wellbeing, by receiving the most appropriate and helpful community-based crisis response at the right time in the right places,” said Provincial Constable Jim Blanchette, an SDG OPP Community Mobilization Officer.

“Calls for service involving mental health continue to rise annually and the severity of the mental health concerns that police encounter is increasingly more complex,” added SDG OPP Staff Sgt. Simon Hardy. “Members of the SDG OPP are excited to have the opportunity to share in this collaboration with community partners who share our vision for safety and wellbeing. The MHCT will expand rural capacity to assist those with mental health issues in our communities. We believe that the MHCT will help enable us to provide the best response and care possible for our residents, our families and our friends.”

The completion of the funding agreement had been delayed as a result of the pandemic, but partners are now prepared to move forward. It has been shown that mental health professionals can provide insights and support during police service calls that result in beneficial outcomes for officers and individuals.

“Cornwall Community Hospital is pleased to work with it’s local partners like the OPP and the United Counties of SDG to support and help address the community’s mental health care needs,” said Jeanette Despatie, President and CEO of CCH. “Front-line response partnerships like these allow us to move forward on our vision of ‘Exceptional Care. Always’.”

Leading up to the 2020 HLPF session, UN Member States attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration to be adopted during the HLPF’s closing session. However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that this has become the norm, but if the meeting had been taking place in person, governments would have been able to adopt it by a vote. “In the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was found.

On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”

In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.

Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.

Participants adopted a Declaration that recognizes multilateralism as a necessity for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, and that implementation of the 2030 Agenda is necessary for survival.

The official commemoration of UN75, which took place at a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government joining virtually, focused on the theme of ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’

The UN Secretary-General warned that the world faces a “surplus of multilateral challenges, and a deficit of multilateral solutions.” In January 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres had launched the UN75 initiative as “the world’s largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.” The UN crowdsourced views on its future priorities and solutions from the global public, through a survey of over a million people in all 193 UN Member States; more than 1,000 dialogues in 82 countries across the world; and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.

Improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty.

Presenting findings from the consultation during the high-level commemoration, Guterres noted they demonstrate the public appetite for increased global solidarity, and emphasized that improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty. Guterres identified gender inequality as the “greatest single challenge to human rights around the world” and expressed concern about the “climate calamity”, rising poverty and nuclear weapons.

UN Security Council President Abdou Abarry said the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exacerbated challenges such as the illicit arms trade, human trafficking, and international terrorism. He also noted that there is no other global organization with the legitimacy and convening power of the UN.

The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Munir Akram said his presidency will focus on mobilizing finance to address the pandemic, achieve the SDGs, avoid the climate catastrophe, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. Four youth leaders called for concrete actions to support those who are left behind and to tackle climate change, among other issues.

President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera, for the least developed countries (LDCs), listed five focus areas for the UN: strengthening multilateralism, including through UN reforms; addressing inequality, including the gender gap and digital divide; financing to implement the 2030 Agenda; pursuing holistic approaches to reflect the singular objective of all SDGs; and promoting a people-centric approach. President of the European Council (EC) Charles Michel, for the EU, underscored the need for COVID-19 treatment to be accessible to all. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), called for revitalizing the UN General Assembly and reforming the Security Council. Many other speakers expressed support for UN reform, and emphasized the importance of multilateralism in COVID-19 recovery and progress towards a more equitable, sustainable world for all.

President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa noted that climate change, environmental disasters, transnational crimes, and migration can be solved only through multilateralism. Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Löfven announced that Sweden will host a conference in Stockholm in 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment.

During the event, Heads of State and Government adopted a ‘Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the UN (A/75/L.1).’ In the Declaration, Member States recognize that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago has not yet been realized: it is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics; people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge and safety; the LDCs are falling behind; and complete decolonization has not been achieved. Further, Member States recognize that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agree that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

In the Declaration, Member States resolve to:

Leave no one behind, with particular attention to people in vulnerable situations.

Protect our planet, including through transformative measures, and by building back better and greener.

Promote peace and prevent conflicts, including through preventive diplomacy and mediation, and respect for international humanitarian law.

Abide by international law and ensure justice.

Place women and girls at the center, and accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women’s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains.

Build trust, by addressing growing inequalities within and among countries, and addressing root causes of inequalities, including violence, human rights abuses, corruption, marginalization, discrimination in all its forms, poverty, and exclusion, as well as lack of education and employment.

Improve digital cooperation and ensure safe and affordable digital access for all.

Upgrade the UN, including by supporting ongoing reform by the UN Secretary-General. They also commit to instill new life in the discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council, continue the work to revitalize the UNGA, and strengthen ECOSOC.

Ensure sustainable financing, including by paying assessed contributions in full and on time; and through the full and timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD).

Boost partnerships, by engaging with all stakeholders including regional and sub-regional organizations, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians.

Listen to, and work with, youth.

Be prepared, including by improving the global crisis prevention and response systems; learning and sharing experiences and information to reduce risks and make our systems more resilient; and accelerating development, production, as well as equitable and affordable global access to new vaccines, medicines, and medical equipment.

The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.

According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.

If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.

Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.

The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council announced that only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries have expressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’

It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

152,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-economic-social-impacts-of-covid-19/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UNCTAD Report Details Economic, Social Impacts of COVID-19","A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretariat finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to “reverse much of the economic and social progress already made” towards SDG achievement. However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

The launches took place as part of an event on ‘American Leadership in Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.’

The side event was organized by The Brookings Institution and the UN Foundation. It convened virtually on 16 September 2020. John Allen, President of The Brookings Institution, welcomed participants and announced that Brookings is creating a new Center for Sustainable Development.

To set the stage for the event, Fatimata Cham, youth poet and activist, performed a poem that concluded with the assurance, and challenge, that “Hope is the sound of your own voice.”

The multiple challenges we are facing demonstrate the importance of local leaders.

Anthony Pipa, The Brookings Institution, highlighted that the 2030 Agenda is an agenda for all sectors, not just national governments. He said the multiple challenges we are currently facing demonstrate how important local leaders are.

Representatives of US cities and companies discussed their work as “engines of action” to implement the SDGs. From the City of Los Angeles, California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said “Leadership is defined by how we react to things that we did not expect to happen,” and noted that the SDG framework helps to make our choices clear when considering policy options. He called attention to LA’s online dashboard to track its progress, and reported that LA is launching an SDGs activities index to help LA residents find new partners.

For the City of New York, Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner for International Affairs, recalled that in 2018, New York launched a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Since then, over 200 local governments and cities have committed to producing VLRs, she reported.

Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon and the Verizon Foundation, discussed her company’s work in relation to SDG 4 (quality education), especially to address inequalities in connectivity. Yvette Pearson, George R. Brown School of Engineering, Rice University, highlighted the need to incorporate societal input into the design of solutions. She said this requires adjustments in engineering curricula.

Launching the first Voluntary University Review (VUR), James Garrett Jr., Carnegie Mellon University, expressed hope that more universities will follow CMU’s lead. He emphasized the importance of dialogues – with local government, NGOs, and the private sector – when creating the VUR.

Governor of Hawai’i David Ige launched the first statewide review of the SDGs (voluntary state review, or VSR). He reviewed the dialogue process used to develop the VSR, with state and local governments, community organizations, and the private sector working to identify shared goals. He said the state will measure progress through a data dashboard to hold itself accountable.

Ige noted that the SDGs provide a common language “to align our canoes in the same direction.” Hawai’i’s US Senator Brian Schatz said policies need to “paint a picture and paint me in it” – they need to work for people, and the SDG framework ensures that policies work for everyone.

Dustin Liu, UNA-USA Youth Observer to the UN, reiterated the discussion’s emphasis on the role of dialogue with multiple stakeholders by calling for including youth voices at all levels of decision making.

Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO, UN Foundation, said it is inspiring to see how groups are using the SDGs. She shared her experience as a government representative who helped negotiate the SDGs five years ago, saying those negotiators did not expect them to resonate across so many groups. Multiple groups have embraced the Goals because, as Cousens emphasized, they are universal, interconnected, and about real challenges faced by people around the world.

It has the potential to take the dialogue further – beyond expressions of commitment to solidarity and cooperation, and into a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.

However, this is a tall order this year, when multilateralism finds itself at a “historic low point” as observed by IISD’s Earth Negotiations Bulletin.

At the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), governments considered drafts of the Ministerial Declaration that had been negotiated in the preceding months. Governments consulted on the draft through remote means, and continue to do so several weeks after the close of the HLPF. (They were unable to vote during the HLPF, which was held virtually, because online voting procedures were not in place.)

In the latest draft, the ministers “reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism” in the context of the UN’s 75th anniversary. They also recognize the UN’s role in “catalysing and coordinating a global response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, based on unity, solidarity, multilateralism and international cooperation.”

COVID-19 has, justifiably, required a large share of the world’s attention in 2020. By its nature, a pandemic and its resulting social, economic, and environmental crises epitomize the need for multilateral cooperation. These interlocking problems have also focused global attention on areas where SDG progress has slowed down and even reversed course. As a result, the draft HLPF declaration notes, “Strengthening multilateralism, international cooperation and global partnership is more important than ever.”

Statements during the HLPF aligned with this view: multilateralism is a top priority for surviving the global pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stressed that the only way out of this crisis is through global solidarity.

However, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s analysis of the HLPF poses the question, “Will multilateralism survive the pandemic?” The ENB suggests that discussions at the HLPF fell short of providing a “clear vision of exactly how multilateralism and the 2030 Agenda can be revived and strengthened.” Instead, speakers belied “an underlying nervousness and recognition that multilateralism is at a historic low point at this time of greatest need.”

The analysis continues,

Some delegates echoed Nepal’s concerns that countries may be too busy saving themselves to show solidarity with others. It is true that the pandemic has evoked nationalistic, beggar-thy-neighbor responses from some countries which, for instance, have diverted shipments of limited supplies of personal protection equipment meant for other countries in “an act of modern piracy;” bought up almost the entire global supply of remdesivir, the anti-viral drug that can speed the recovery of coronavirus patients; or have been accused of “vaccine nationalism” for trying to secure priority access to a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

Among the action areas for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, the ENB reports that participants highlighted:

promoting solidarity and partnerships;

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

reform of international financial institutions;

broadening of the causes and measures of vulnerability;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

The high-level commemoration of UN75 on 21 September 2020 could serve to organize actions like these into a set of concrete priorities to rebuild trust in institutions and reignite cooperation that serves all partners, equally.

The UN2020 initiative, a coalition of civil society representatives, has crafted a “people’s declaration” for the UN’s 75th anniversary. It calls for a process to design a coherent strategy to fill global governance gaps. It also contains a plan for global action with three priority recommendations for the UN and Member States:

Establish a Member-State-mandated post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance, ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions;

Reliably and increasingly fund the UN including by addressing the challenge of unfulfilled Member States’ annual dues and financial commitments, streamlining “archaic” UN budgetary processes, and considering global taxation on fossil fuel, carbon or other commodities; and

Enhance participation modalities for civil society and other stakeholders with: a dedicated civil society focal point in the UN Secretariat at the level of Under-Secretary-General; a system-wide review of stakeholder participation in UN processes and adoption of a few well-designed reform proposals; increased use of communications technology to mitigate the digital divide; and a global petition mechanism to surface issues of concern for a critical mass of individuals.

The plan for global action also contains an annex of additional proposals generated through the civil society consultations leading up to the People’s Forum.

Whether leaders take forward these recommendations or others that may emerge through the UN75 commemoration and related global conversation, there is certainly space for a “clear vision” and plan of action to strengthen multilateralism and ensure the world moves closer to the 2030 Agenda, not ever further from the future we want.","The high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary will be the culmination of a year’s discussions on multilateralism.
However, this is a tall order this year, when multilateralism finds itself at a “historic low point” as observed by IISD’s Earth Negotiations Bulletin.
In the latest draft, the ministers “reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism” in the context of the UN’s 75th anniversary.

We are facing a planetary emergency – a nature crisis, a climate crisis, and an inequality crisis all at once. Yet the world’s level of ambition to tackle our nature crisis to date has been lackluster, with a recent report highlighting that the world has failed to achieve most of the global biodiversity ambitions that the world agreed to in 2010, as part of a decade-long strategic plan for nature.

The result of low levels of leadership and political will in implementing the global plan, along with ever increasing threats to ecosystem and biodiversity coming from economic sectors, has been predictable – a recent report on the state of biodiversity found that the world has lost 68% of all wildlife populations since 1970.

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global diversity framework requires eliminating “negative money.”

To fully respond to this emergency, we need bold ambition, commitment, and action at all levels, from local to global, and across different sectors and constituencies. We need a multi-pronged “whole-of-society approach” to redefine our relationship with nature towards constructing a nature-based planetary safety net.

This article provides updates on progress in five areas.

Committing to Financing Nature

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework will require a significant increase in financial resources from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue.

It also requires eliminating “negative money.” For example, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year as agriculture, fisheries, and other subsidies to incentivize activities that degrade or destroy nature. All told, the finance gap for protecting 30% of the planet is about USD700 billion a year. However, a new report shows that this finance gap is not as large as it seems – it accounts for just under one percent of global GDP, and is a tiny fraction of the USD5.2 trillion we spend in fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the benefits of protecting nature outweigh the costs by at least 5:1. The best investment ever!

Reversing Biodiversity Loss by 2030 Through Global Commitment

Global, national, and sub-national leaders can no longer ignore our planetary crisis. Indeed, more than 1,700 jurisdictions have already declared a climate emergency. Now world leaders have begun to mobilize around a pledge for nature. More than 50 heads of state have already signed a pledge for nature, and 30 more are in the process of endorsing.

Among other statements, this pledge includes a recognition of the nature crisis, and calls for an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. To accompany this commitment, the Club of Rome has developed a concrete plan to emerge from our emergency.

Creating a Nature-Based Planetary Safety Net

The year 2021 will see the agreement by the world’s governments on a bold biodiversity framework through 2030, with an eye towards a planet in harmony with nature by 2050.

Building on the indivisible relation between the wellbeing of people and the wellbeing of nature, the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) will begin by looking back to the past decade, identifying reasons for hope in national and local action on biodiversity. COP 15 will then look forward, identifying key elements required for achieving success, including bold political will, coherent and aligned government policies, integration and alignment of a wide range of economic sectors, adequate resource mobilization, and decisive action, among others.

Greening Covid-19 Recovery Efforts and Creating Green New Deals

COVID-19 has taught us that business as usual is no longer an option. This crisis highlights the socio-economic threats and costs posed by our planetary emergency, and offers an opportunity to accelerate the transition to more inclusive, greener, and more resilient economies. Decisions made now on how to stimulate growth, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and prevent the next pandemic will determine the future health, well-being, and stability of both people and the planet.

To take action, countries can:

“green” their stimulus packages and longer-term national recovery plans;

promote green public work programs;

redirect harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies;

integrate nature-climate concerns into agriculture, water resources, forestry, tourism, industry, mining, energy, and infrastructure; and

promote sustainable public/private finance and investments.

Mapping Nature for People and Planet

More than 2,200 satellites circle the earth, enabling humanity to monitor the planet in ways never imagined possible. Enabled by the UNDP-led UN Biodiversity Lab, governments are beginning to use spatial data from these satellites, and combine these datasets with local and national data to generate new insight.

Supported by UNDP, and with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Government of Sweden, and One Earth, five governments – Uganda, Costa Rica, Peru, Kazakhstan and Colombia – have initiated a new process, called Mapping Nature For People and Planet: Essential Life Support Areas. Using satellite data, local and national data, and the principles of systematic conservation planning, these governments are able to pinpoint where actions on nature protection, restoration, and sustainable management will help them meet their nature-dependent national development goals, especially for water, food, climate, livelihoods, safety, and biodiversity. As Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the new head of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Francis Ogwal, co-chair of the working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, explain in a recent blog, such maps are an essential component for planning, implementing, and monitoring bold ambition and action on nature.

2020 was supposed to be a ‘Super Year for Nature.’ But even though all major biodiversity events have been postponed or cancelled, the recent gains in these five trends give us reasons for hope. To learn more, and for a dose of hope, visit www.NatureForLifeHub.org.

On 24 September 2020, the Hub featured sessions on how nature can support achieving the SDGs, with a focus on: nature for climate; nature for water; and scaling up financing. The session on Nature for Climate emphasized the role of ecosystems in climate change mitigation, with one participant saying the world has woken up to the fact that nature underpins our economy and the spread of COVID-19 has confirmed that protecting nature is about protecting ourselves. The benefits from protecting nature are delivered immediately and accrued to locals, he reminded. He stressed as the necessary next steps: defunding deforestation; promoting equity and social justice; and prioritizing natural climate solutions in economic recovery.

The world has woken up: protecting nature is about protecting our economy and ourselves.

Other key messages included:

forests and nature can deliver a third of the needed emission reductions, and reversing their degradation will be fundamental for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement;

natural climate solutions have moved to the center of the climate change debate, and they are increasingly understood to be an essential complement to decarbonization in climate action; and

nature-based solutions, however, have only received 3% of global climate finance.

In a joint statement, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called for: placing nature at the heart of sustainable development; building a green, inclusive and circular economy; and mobilizing action from every corner of society. Zac Goldsmith, Minister for Pacific and the Environment, UK, said his government will increase the share spent on nature-based solutions in its climate finance.

A session on Nature for Water highlighted how nature-based solutions can build long-term water security. Key messages included:

Water is finite, but our need for it is growing – this relationship needs balancing.

Communities, cities, corporations, and other stakeholders are already engaging in activities that integrate nature-based solutions into water management while generating social and economic benefits.

Trust is a crucial element for ensuring acceptance for nature-based solutions that require investments, and a lot more can be accomplished when various stakeholders work together.

Further efforts are needed to: quantify the benefits of nature-based solutions to build an evidence base for support; nature-based solutions and “grey solutions” need to be assessed holistically; and enabling environments for nature-based solutions need to enhanced.

Among other success stories, Xanthea Limburg, City of Cape Town, explained how the city’s water strategy builds on the experience of successfully avoiding “day zero” in 2018 (when the municipal water supply almost had to be cut off) and includes the principle of working with nature. Ulrike Sapiro, The Coca-Cola Company, said that, of her company’s 300 water replenishment projects that seek to replenish all water the company uses in production processes globally, 230 are dedicated to working with nature.

Stuart Orr, WWF, observed a growing interest in mainstreaming nature-based solutions from investors who see water scarcity-related risks affecting their assets. As constraints to mobilizing financing, Gilles Kleitz, French Development Agency, identified a lack of: technical and performance standards for nature-based solutions; active dialogue with consultancies on performance; and rigorous financing models for NBS.

On 25 September, the Nature for Life Hub focused on business and finance. A key theme was the need to disrupt business-as-usual by placing nature at the center of decision-making. Participants discussed ways to better align goals to protect, restore and sustainably manage nature with goals for sustainable economic development and financial investment. During this event, the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge was launched. Through this Pledge, 26 financial institutions committed to protect and restore biodiversity through their finance activities and investments.

On 28 September – dubbed “global ambition day” – global leaders and stakeholders showcased commitments to promoting a nature-based planetary safety net. A Nature Finance Forum presented key message including:

governments must de-risk investments to create incentives for the private sector;

governments alone cannot create change – philanthropists also need to target their efforts;

businesses must be mobilized to reduce their own carbon footprints and to help establish enabling environments for entrepreneurs; and

finance is needed for Indigenous stewards and to protect the poorest communities who depend on biodiversity

The Day included a Leaders’ Event to mark the launch of the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, developed by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Belize, Bhutan, Colombia, Costa Rica, EU, Finland, Kenya, Seychelles and UK, along with intergovernmental and NGO partner organizations. The pledge was launched in support of the first UN Summit on Biodiversity, on 30 September 2020, and the post-2020 biodiversity framework, which countries are expected to agree on at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China (CBD COP 15) in 2021.

Endorsers and supporters of the pledge commit to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, through ten specific actions. At the time of the event, the pledge had attracted endorsements by 70 countries and numerous non-state actors, and hosts expected this number to keep rising.

Opening the event, Volkan Bozkır, President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), lamented that none of the Aichi Targets on biodiversity have been fully achieved, and expressed hope that the September Summit “elevate the political discourse on biodiversity” and become an important step on the road to Kunming.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for the new global biodiversity framework to provide a roadmap for implementation. He commended leaders for launching the pledge and called on everyone to make 2021 “nature’s year.”

In pre-recorded statements, government leaders underscored:

There is a need to recognize the interdependence between people and ecosystems.

The current market system fails to capture most ecosystem values. Natural capital needs to be restored, and societies must change how they finance, produce and consume.

Goals related to the pledge include zero biodiversity loss, nature-positive development, carbon neutrality, and resilience.

Biodiversity conservation is a strategic investment in health, jobs, livelihoods and food security, and protects humanity from diseases.

Urgent, practical and ambitious actions are needed, including robust goals and strong monitoring mechanisms.

All parts of governments should engage in implementing the pledge, and concerted action is needed from governments, businesses and civil society.

Indigenous experience and knowledge should be harnessed, and local communities need to be enlisted to support implementation.

Economic recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate the goal of “saving our life support system.”

Business and civil society leaders highlighted that:

Economies and businesses depend on nature.

Humanity is pushing the planet dangerously close to a tipping point that could result in irreversible destabilization of the system.

Governments need to create the conditions for the private sector to achieve the biodiversity targets.

Financial institutions have announced a Finance for Biodiversity Pledge that includes a target of collaborating and sharing knowledge, engaging with companies, setting targets and reporting on them publicly, by 2024.

60 major faith traditions will develop “faith long-term plans” to protect nature.

Equity, justice and women’s rights should be at the heart of efforts to halt biodiversity loss.

Nature is fundamental for protecting human health.

Closing the day, CBD Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called on all stakeholders to come together in global solidarity to take urgent action. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen outlined five areas where transitions are necessary: food systems; resource extraction; energy systems; green infrastructure investments; and land degradation. She called on governments to ensure all post-COVID-19 stimulus packages include “green strings” and reminded that “failure is not an option.”

The fourth day focused on Local Action, with ten winners of the Equator Prize announced.

Deutsche Post DHL Group, Microsoft Corp. and the PwC network (“PwC”) have already joined the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility and the initiative is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to contribute.

The Global Facility is a response to corporate calls to action for private sector leaders and governments to work together to address the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The initiative has been established to better coordinate their responses, helping to ensure that immediate stimulus efforts flow into the real economy.

The Global Facility will operate at both the global and national levels. It aims to co-create solutions that are tailored to the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given area and the specificities of the local private sector and government context. Guided by the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Facility will support a multisectoral, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to face the multidimensional nature of the crisis. Recovery efforts will focus on how to rebuild more inclusive economies and societies, to set a new course for a socially just, low-carbon and climate-resilient world where no one is left behind. Initial projects will focus on the countries of Colombia, Ghana, the Philippines and Turkey. Both the geographical scope and participating partners will expand as the Global Facility develops.

“Solidarity to ‘Recover Better Together’ can boost our collective efforts not only to cope with the crisis but overcome it. UNDP’s footprint across some 170 countries and territories, combined with the UN Global Compact’s network of more than 10,000 companies and 68 Local Networks around the world, and the International Chamber of Commerce’s network of over 45 million companies, multiplies our collective capacity and potential. The Facility is the first of its kind – designed to join forces across public and private sectors to serve humanity in an imperative moment,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility was announced by Mr Steiner at the SDG Business Forum during the UN General Assembly, the largest and most inclusive UN convening of private sector leaders. Launched under the motto “Recover Better Together”, the timing of this initiative has special importance, marking the commemoration of some important UN-related milestones: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations; the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Compact; and the Centenary of ICC’s founding after WWI at a time when multilateralism is facing the greatest challenge of its generation.

Initiating partners

The Initiating Partners are UNDP, UN Global Compact and ICC. Together, they will bring their unique access to global expertise on responsible business practices, economic recovery, green business transformation and multi-hazard risk management.

“As COVID-19 disrupts societies, development agendas must adjust accordingly. There is a need for inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the critical contributions of civil society, business, foundations, the research community, local authorities, cities and regional governments. By unlocking public-private and private-private cooperation for a sustainable response to COVID-19 challenges, it is possible to recover better and build more resilient economies,” said Mr Steiner.

The private sector has been acutely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact affirm the belief that businesses exist to serve and advance their societies, and their success cannot come at the cost of social or environmental regression.

“It is a moment of human tragedy and intense economic and social upheaval. But it is also a moment of possibility. Through partnerships like the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility we will support companies to Recover Better Together from the pandemic and finally confront global inequality by taking action, as well as mitigate the worst impacts of a climate emergency that threatens all of humanity. Together we can construct a new paradigm of resilience,” saidSanda Ojiambo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced around 70% of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to shut down their operations. SMEs represent 50% of global GDP and more than 70% of global employment. The partners of the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility, representing multinational, global and local private sector stakeholders, commit to joint projects to develop policy and financial solutions for pandemic relief.

ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said: “ICC’s local networks can bring value to the cooperation by reaching small business owners who want to have their challenges understood, their ideas heard, and their efforts to Recover Better recognised and built upon by others. SMEs need a way to facilitate this vital exchange of ideas, learning and experience with each other and with organisations and institutions in a position to support them.”

﻿

Private sector involvement

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility is supported by strategic partners DHL, Microsoft and PwC, and is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to join this initiative. The strategic partners will add their expertise and technology to support this transformational recovery.

“In the current situation our employees recognize more than ever before their contribution to the well-being of the population. Under extremely difficult circumstances Deutsche Post DHL Group kept the global flow of goods, secured supply chains and provided the world with the necessary protective equipment. We want to share our experience of operating during one of the biggest health crises in recent history to protect lives against the pandemic. Join our efforts of connecting people improving lives to address the upcoming challenges together with our long standing partner UNDP,” said Monika Schaller, EVP Group Communications, Sustainability and Brand.

Deutsche Post DHL Group embarked upon the idea to support the Global Facility before its launch. The company underlined that their world-wide network enables them to make a difference on the ground for the local SMEs and helps them to survive in the present situation by solving logistical constraints.

“In line with Microsoft’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, we firmly believe technology can be a force for good in these challenging times and we’re proud to partner with public and private sector partners in an effort to accelerate global recovery. We see The Global Facility as an opportunity to create economic opportunities for all, bring our sustainability investments forward to support growth and recovery in a manner that advances our shared environmental agendas, and use data and AI to a build a system of intelligence to help all stakeholders better target their efforts to the communities that need the most help.” said Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft VP and Global Head of Tech for Social Impact.

Firms from the global professional services network PwC joined the initiative at its conceptual stage with UNDP. PwC will continue to play an instrumental role in supporting the design and establishment of this flagship global public-private cooperation. Additionally, PwC will help to develop finance and policy solutions and coordinate multistakeholder engagement. PwC’s role in the Global Facility is led by PwC Poland and supported by PwC Canada, PwC Hungary, PwC India, PwC Norway, PwC Middle East, PwC Switzerland, PwC Turkey and PwC UK.

“At PwC, our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Together with our clients and communities, we are working to assess and mitigate the major challenges that the pandemic poses for our economies and societies.

The members of the United Nations Global Compact CFO Taskforce have identified four key areas as the principles’ focus: SDG impact and measurement, integrated SDG strategies and investments, integrated corporate SDG Finance and integrated SDG communication and reporting. Complementing the Ten Principles of the Global Compact, those identified by the CFOs aim at involving the global community of financial managers so that the entire value chain linked to investments creates a market that is larger, more liquid and efficient for SDG investments and capital flows.

Francesco Tanzi, Pirelli’s Chief Financial Officer said: “Integrating SDGs into Corporate Finance and Investment is key to accelerating the achievement of global goals through impact actions. This belief is core to Pirelli’s participation as a founding member in the UN CFO Taskforce for SDGs, alongside its development model focused on “partnerships for the goals”.

Pirelli will be an active part of the working groups of the CFO Taskforce for SDGs to develop guidelines, case histories and “pilot operations” to facilitate the adoption and implementation of the Principles.

Pirelli, the only tyre company included, confirmed UN Global Compact Lead

During the 75th UN General Assembly, Pirelli, the only tyre company included, was also recognized, together with 40 other companies around the world, part of the UN Global Compact Lead that groups together companies that have been identified for their greater commitment to the implementation of the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact as well as the advancement of global sustainability goals.

The UN Global Compact is the biggest corporate sustainability initiative in the world. To qualify as LEAD, a company must take part in at least two Global Compact “Action Platforms” which bring together companies. Local networks, academia, civil society and governments to address complex questions of sustainability and deliver innovation in favour of the global goals.In addition, participants must communicate their progress through an annual report on sustainability that shows in detail progress achieved and the actuation of the Ten Principles.

Belonging to the UN Global Compact, which Pirelli joined in 2004, is testament to the corporate conviction that effective solutions should be pursued through a holistic approach to development, which integrates economic, social and environmental capital, and rests on the joint efforts of companies and stakeholders at the global level.

A key theme of the 30-minute video was the importance of strategic partnerships and collaboration to effectively meet the challenges of poverty in our community, and how the United Way of SDG strives to be a leader in poverty reduction.

“A dollar to the United Way is spent in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing costs, sharing expertise and building together the community we call home,” said Juliette Labossière, Executive Director of United Way of SDG, during the live virtual event.

The United Way/Centraide of SDG members continued to grow in 2020 with the organization funding 16 local agencies and 20 programs compared to 14 agencies and 16 programs in 2019. In 2020-2021, the United Way of SDG will invest $337,786 into the community through these 16 agencies who all fall under the organization’s three pillars: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be and building strong and healthy communities.

Labossière further talked about the increased relevancy of The United Way of SDG and several local organizations during the current pandemic, touching on how strategic partnerships with the Social Development Council of Cornwall & Area, 30 members of the Emergency Response Council, and the generosity of the City of Cornwall and citizens across our entire region contributed to fewer people being negatively impacted by the pandemic than could have been. It was the advocacy and a coordinated approach through these partnerships that enabled the United Way of SDG to distribute $530,000 into our region over the last 5 months. This included Akwesasne, Cornwall and all of our counties.

The work to ease our way out of the pandemic, however, is far from over and the United Way of SDG worries about the real social impact of the pandemic that will emerge in the next few months.

“I urge you to think about the United Way as the united front that will assist our community and non-profits to weather this upcoming storm and support the community on all levels as necessary,” Labossière asked of the viewers as their support is vital to the United Way’s continued work in the community.

David Booyink, Campaign Chair, also shared a few words on why he volunteers, “I’ve always had this growing desire since I was a young boy to save lives, to make a difference.” Volunteering is a way everyone can help, and the United Way of SDG urges you to research its member agencies and look for opportunities to get involved.

Maureen Miller, a mother of two, shared how volunteers changed her life. She discussed her experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall (a United Way of SDG member agency), emphasizing just how much of an impact the program has had on her kids’ lives. It has given them the support and friendships they need to find happiness and explore new opportunities that they may not have had if not for the mentorship of their Big Brothers and Big Sister.

And to end the live event, John Hoyles, Executive Director of the Community Information Centre of Ottawa, shared an important resource that everyone in SDG can use. 211 is an informational helpline and website that connects people to the right information and services to navigate life’s challenges. This resource saw a 20% increase in SDG during the first few months of COVID-19 and Hoyles expects it will increase in popularity as we move into winter.

“The most important thing for us is to get more people to know about 211,” Hoyles stressed as this is a service for people to turn to when they have nowhere to go. His goal is to “make 211 just as known as 911,” and encourages viewers to help spread the word about this lifeline for the people who need it.

The United Way of SDG is happy to announce that it has already raised $620 to kick-off its 2020 Campaign, It needs our community’s support now more than ever to push us through the next few challenging months.

These included strategic partnerships the United Way of SDG had established over the last few years, such as with the Social Development Council of Cornwall and Area, as well as the 30 or so members of the Regional Emergency Response Council. In addition, she also praised the generosity of not only the citizens of Cornwall and SDG, but also of the city itself.

This included Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall and Area executive director Ron Graham, as well as John Hoyles, of Ontario 211. In addition, Steven Douris, himself a big brother with the organization, spoke to a local mother, who’s two children have benefited from the BBBS’ mentoring programs. Identified only as Maureen, the woman told listeners how both her daughter and her son were matched with mentors, which then allowed them to blossom in later years. “It’s unbelievable how much it has helped,” she said. “For my son, he’s been given healthy male role models which obviously I cannot be for him. My daughter is a bit shy and her big sister, and her big sister’s family, because they have all welcomed her into their home, they have brought her out of her shell.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

The “Spark” Mentorships & Grants Program is being launched to encourage individuals, entrepreneurs, small businesses and non-profits to apply with their new tourism ideas for the region – more important than ever as the tourism industry begins its renewal and recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Applications will be accepted begin immediately and until Oct. 30.

“We’re all about sparking news tourism possibilities,” said Justin Lafontaine, program lead for the Ontario Tourism Innovation Lab that has partnered with Cornwall and SDG.

“Certainly we’ve all been through a challenging time, but at the same time there are new opportunities to expand and re-imagine local tourism.”

The Spark program will match three selected applicants from the region with a tourism mentor, providing a $3,000 grant to assist each in taking the new idea to the next level of development. The process will include what Lafontaine called a “friendly take” on a Dragon’s Den format that’ll have the ideas pitched to a panel.","Looking to spark tourism initiatives across Cornwall and SDGArticle contentA new tourism innovation program has launched in Cornwall and SDG.

Article content McGrath is a member of the newspaper’s community editorial board, and she learned about a similar type of farm-hopping event in Quebec that was attended by fellow editorial board member Jesse Good. McGrath pitched the idea to COG, and it became a reality – a successful one. At Springfield Farm there was a steady stream of guests all day, and, overall, over 150 signed up for the tour.

It was back in 2014 when McGrath, a documentary filmmaker, and McCarthy, an engineer – the couple has four children – purchased the over 200-year-old, 118-acre farm, and began splitting their time between what is life in the Toronto rat race and the solitude of Glengarry, working to establish Springfield in the growing agri-tourism/local food economy. There were organically-grown vegetables for sale at Springfield, walking tours, a variety of other activities – and lots of interest in a work-in-progress café. McCarthy talked about the “field-to-table” experience and Springfield’s experimenting in different crops over the years. “Some have been very successful,” McCarthy said. “This year garlic was very successful here.” The Farm Hop event ran in two, two-hour blocks, late on Saturday morning and from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.

Freezer beef and freezer chicken is sold at Jamink Farm, which has been organic since 2002, and owned by Thomas Booijink since 2013 when he bought it from his parents. “(Farm Hop is) all about reconnecting with your farmer and (learning more about) where your food comes from,” Julia said. “(Organic farming is) all about the quality of the food and leaving the land better for the next generation.” It’s a passion for the Booijinks and, in Julia’s case, goes back to her growing up on a dairy farm in Almonte. And after graduating from University of Guelph, and when Julia was living in the Woodstock area, she was milking cows in a rented barn there. Fifty cows were eventually moved from Woodstock to Jamink Farm, which had to get certified again as organic, and in 2013 it started shipping organic milk once again. Other Farm Hop participants included Alexandria’s Dream Small Farm, as well as at sites in Dalkeith, St-Eugene and St-Pascal-Baylon. Participants were asked to register online and choose which farm or farms they wished to visit, in order to comply with COVID-19 safety measures. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

The event underscored that accelerating ocean-based solutions can support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and delivery of the SDGs.

According to the UN Global Compact’s Ocean Stewardship 2030 report released in May 2020, five tipping points could secure a healthy and productive ocean. These are:

Fully traceable sustainable seafood;

Decarbonized shipping (“set sail for zero”);

Harnessing ocean electricity;

Mapping the ocean; and

Ending waste entering the ocean.

During the review event, five CEO Roundtables addressed these tipping points. The review resulted in an Outcome Document of the 2020 CEO Roundtables on Ocean, identifying actions business can take to advance the five areas. On sustainable seafood, the outcome document recommends: contributing to standardize traceability data, harmonize standards and promote interoperability of traceability platforms through the seafood value chain; and increasing the recognition of seafood in the climate and food agendas.



On decarbonizing shipping, recommendations include: providing incentives to develop and scale up low- or zero-carbon fuels, and support transparency and financial capacity; engaging with governments and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in setting up a global research and development fund and calling for further policy action; and sharing best practices regarding technology for zero-emission vessels.



On harnessing ocean energy, the document highlights action areas related to: developing a framework for global strategic planning by governments, in dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and increasing standardization of the industry and setting up global certifications and key performance indicators.

On ending waste entering the ocean, the document calls for: defining the “rules of the game” such as through dependable regulations for the private sector, to facilitate greater public-private collaboration to end ocean plastic; and determining the institutions needed to rapidly scale plastic pollution solutions across countries, as well as funding them.



On mapping the ocean, the outcome document recommends: conducting a gap analysis to take stock of ongoing ocean data initiatives, and data and information needs; and identifying enabling factors and the necessary means to implement them, including support for developing countries, in collecting, sharing, and using ocean data.

On delivering on the Decade of Action, participants identified barriers and actions for business and governments to realize the ambitions highlighted in the Ocean Stewardship 2030 report. SDG 14 (life below water) addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Four of the targets of SDG 14 are due to be achieved by 2020.

167,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-implementation-and-accountability-bring-on-the-data/,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Implementation and Accountability: Bring on the Data,"Next week the UN will hold a virtual UN World Data Forum, featuring the expertise of statisticians and sustainable development professionals from around the world. The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

The researchers divide the suggested interventions into three focus areas:

On the farm—including training for farmers, developing climate-resilient crops, and improving livestock feed (USD 9 billion);

Food on the move—ensuring food can get from the farm to market, through investments in storage, transport, and other infrastructure (USD 2 billion); and

Empower the excluded— measures to ensure the poorest are included, such as steps regarding social protection spending or training for rural youth (USD 3 billion).

This Ceres2030 project was led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The researchers used two interlinked research approaches to develop their findings. The first involved the development of a machine-learning tool to analyze over 500,000 published reports and articles. This tool helped the team of 78 researchers from 23 countries to summarize the evidence from over 20 years of agricultural development literature. The second part of the research involved economic modelling. The researchers created a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how much it would cost to end hunger, increase incomes and protect the climate by 2030.

The proposed additional USD 14 billion per year until 2030 would represent a doubling in the amount of aid currently given for food security and nutrition each year. The researchers note that it must be accompanied by an additional USD 19 billion a year from low- and middle-income countries’ own budgets.

The research findings support an integrated approach, recognizing that “agricultural interventions are more effective with a population that enjoys at least a minimum level of income, education, with access to networks and resources such as extension services and robust infrastructure.” The research also revealed that it is more effective to create integrated portfolios of interventions rather than to support improvements in isolation from one another.

Regarding women’s empowerment, the researchers indicate that the evidence base is sparse, due to the fact that only 10% of the papers reviewed considered gender differences in the outcomes of the interventions.

The researchers organize their 10 key recommendations for donor governments based on the three focus areas for interventions, as follows.

Empower the excluded:

Support participation in farmers’ organizations

Invest in vocational programs for rural youth that offer integrated-training in multiple skills

Scale up social protection programs to help create a bridge for people living in poverty to find productive jobs

On the Farm:

Invest in information and training, particularly for women, to increase the uptake of new technologies

Ensure new environmentally-friendly farming methods are also economically viable

Support the adoption of climate-resilient crops

Increase research on how to help small-scale producers in water-scarce regions

Target improvements in the quantity and quality of livestock feed to small and medium-sized commercial farms

Food on the Move:

To reduce post-harvest losses, look beyond the storage of cereals to also focus on other food groups and other parts of the food value chain

Invest in the infrastructure, regulations, services and technical assistance needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that supply or buy from small-scale farmers

The findings from the review of literature were published by Nature Research in a new research collection of peer-reviewed journal articles.

More than 4.5 billion people now use the internet and over 3.8 billion are active on social media, Data shows the average internet user now spends 6 hours and 42 minutes online each day , which equates to more than 100 days of connected time per internet user per year, or roughly 40 percent of our waking lives.

""It became clear to me that we live in a digital-first, work-from-home world, yet not one of the 17 Sustainable Goals addresses a fair, more liveable digital future for our fast-evolving and technology-driven world,"" says Sebastian Jespersen, CEO of Vertic. ""What if we could significantly enhance our quality of life with an additional UN Sustainable Development Goal that encourages companies to use data for mutual benefit rather than for unwelcomed intrusion or manipulation?""

The increased need for data privacy has become a major issue of late with regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) leading the charge. While some consumers around the globe are gaining rights regarding how their data is collected, stored, and sold, while holding companies accountable when poor data security practices lead to data breaches involving their personally identifiable information (PII), there are also gaping holes for others.

""Today, the data brands retain about the people they serve is of little value if it's primarily used to harass people and intrude upon their online experience"" continues Jespersen. ""What if companies could commit to providing customers with a richer and protected online future through an enhanced and acceptable life with data? Our digital world should be as safe and livable as our physical world. Global corporations should act responsibly online as well as offline. As with all the other SDG areas, we need universal standards that go beyond national laws to protect users and their data.""

Vertic has begun working with leading customers and partners to explore at the implications of how concerns about today's digital life can become part of a UN SDG initiative. The agency will release a series of videos with thought-leaders, technology providers and governmental organizations on the topic.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

This year’s work will include negotiating the 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of the UN’s operational activities for development (QCPR).

On 5 October 2020, the Committee, chaired by the Permanent Representative of Nepal, held an in-person session to adopt its programme of work for the year. The Committee also began its general debate on the theme of ‘Building back better after COVID-19: Ensuring a more equitable global economy, inclusive societies and sustainable recovery.’

We must take full advantage of the improvements we have made to the UN development system, to help countries recover better from COVID-19.

The Chair said the Committee will focus on issues affecting groups of countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). He also highlighted:

the Food Systems Summit being planned for 2021,

the Committee will discuss the modalities for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028, through a high-level event convening from 22-24 March 2023, in New York, and

it is time to conduct the QCPR, which takes place every four years and was last conducted in 2016.

In a keynote address to the Second Committee, Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, said the international community cannot squeeze water from a stone: developing economies and emerging markets cannot find financial resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic without significant debt restructuring. He expressed support for the issuance of special drawing rights.

Stiglitz also called for multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes, such as by creating a minimum global corporate income tax at the level of 2%. He added that greening economies can be timely, targeted, labor-intensive, and provide good stimulus.

Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said COVID-19 stimulus packages will be most effective if they prioritize public investments that contribute to achieving the SDGs, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and digital infrastructure.

Member States speaking during the debate emphasized the need for stronger international cooperation to face the “seemingly endless cycles” of COVID-19, especially in States that lack recovery financing. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged “vaccine multilateralism” to ensure equitable, universal, and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Another delegate suggested considering vaccines and therapeutic treatments as global public goods.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) noted some government’s “retreat” from the development agenda and climate change commitments. She also noted the inability of SIDS to access available climate finance because of “cumbersome processes and competition with other better capacitated countries.”

Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) said “there should be no rollback of existing commitments,” and it is vital to promote full participation of people with disabilities, women and children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. He supported new approaches to addressing the debt crisis and maintain jobs, particularly in the LDCs. The general debate continues until 9 October 2020 in a virtual format.

Also during the Second Committee’s in-person meeting on 5 October, UN Deputy Secretary‑General Amina Mohammed’s provided a briefing on the 2020 QCPR, noting that it takes place at the outset of the Decade of Action for sustainable development.

Recalling that the previous QCPR in 2016 “paved the way for the deepest transformation in the history” of the UN development system, Mohammed reported that the UN has since established a new coordination system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda, including a funding compact with Member States. In May 2020, during the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, she said governments decided to move forward on other mandates set out in the 2016 QCPR, including to operationalize a new regional architecture, strengthen support to multi‑country offices (MCOs), and bolster independent system‑wide evaluations for accountability.

Mohammed said that now, to help countries recover better from COVID-19, “we must take full advantage of the improvements we have made” to the UN development system. She called on Member States to give strategic direction to this process through the 2020 QCPR, particularly in the following ways:

Additional resources are needed in priority policy areas, including climate change, economic transformation and employment, women’s empowerment, and digitalization;

At the country level, the UN is introducing integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs, and the QCPR can provide clarity on expectations;

Coherence between the UN’s pillars;

On leaving no one behind, the QCPR “can give visibility to those excluded and on the margins,” including persons with disabilities and women and girls. She said the process can also clarify Member States’ expectations for a recovery from COVID‑19 that is anchored in inclusive and green economies, and noted that greater investment is needed in data for evidence‑based decision‑making; and

Completing the “unfinished business” of the 2016 QCPR, such as meeting the targets of the funding compact.

In addition to deliberations on its official agenda items, the Committee will hold three other events. A joint meeting with ECOSOC will address ‘Developing sustainable infrastructure and utilizing science and technology in response to COVID-19,’ on 14 October. A virtual side event on ‘Disaster risk-informed and resilient COVID-19 recovery’ will take place on 15 October. An annual dialogue with the executive secretaries of the UN regional commissions is scheduled for 19 October.

Action on draft resolutions is expected to take place in November.

The brief titled, ‘Role of economic instruments for the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ calls for greater understanding of cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments as potential tools to mobilize resources and help countries achieve sound chemicals and waste management.

Costing instruments can create incentives to not pollute, and create a level playing field for producers.

The authors explain that some external costs arising from the unsound management of chemicals and waste are not accounted for in the price of goods and products. With the global chemicals industry (including pharmaceuticals) worth approximately USD 5.7 trillion and expected to double by 2030, many have called for more action to internalize these costs throughout the chemicals value chain.

Cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments aim to provide signals and incentives to stimulate behavioral change across the value chain. They can bring about benefits including:

internalizing and reflecting the true cost of the production, consumption, and final disposal of goods;

creating an incentive to not pollute or create waste;

providing revenues so countries can, for example: fund national chemical authorities and develop infrastructure for waste collection, sorting, and recycling;

responding to increased consumer demand for sustainability and accountability;

creating a level playing field so producers follow the same rules and standards; and

contributing to national commitments towards the SDGs.

SDG 3 calls for reducing illness and deaths linked to chemical exposure (SDG target 3.9), SDG 12 is ‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,’ and three other Goals (SDGs 6, 14, and 15) address the need to reduce pollution as a key driver of biodiversity loss.

The brief reports that governments are using cost recovery measures and economic instruments to generate additional resources, which on chemicals management include taxes, fees, tradeable permits, and subsidies. On waste, targeted tools include: extended producer responsibility (EPR); deposit refund schemes to discourage improper disposal; and pay-as-you-throw, which supports waste collection activities.

Prerequisites for governments to use cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments, the authors say, may include:

political will and national vision;

ambitious targets;

public-private collaboration;

financial resources, including seed funding to institutionalize a policy framework for chemical safety;

a flexible legal foundation based on sound data and design;

designated institutional body;

third-party verification of products;

revenues from cost recovery fees that go toward ensuring chemicals safety and waste management; and

monitoring framework to track progress.

The Beyond 2020 framework is currently under deliberation, and outcomes are expected at the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in 2021. To secure financing beyond 2020, the brief describes next steps such as to conduct research drawing on lessons from the “biodiversity incentives” of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Bank’s carbon pricing programme. On providing capacity support, the brief suggests collecting best practices at the national level to create a “living document” for inclusion in the SAICM knowledge management platform to guide national action. On developing policy and tracking progress, the brief mentions developing: a global cost internalization programme; relevant indicators for Beyond 2020 to monitor use of mechanisms and instruments; and a common harmonized framework to improve tracking, reporting and assessment of finance flows.

The brief draws from and complements an earlier SAICM document, ‘Review of cost recovery mechanisms and other economic instruments for financing of the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ which was prepared in advance of ICCM4.

During the last three weeks, the following countries have indicated their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR):

Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, Nicaragua, and San Marino, for their first VNRs;

Cabo Verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Japan, Namibia, and Tunisia, for their second VNRs; and

Colombia, for its third VNR.

The following 30 countries had already expressed an interest as of 30 September 2020:

First-time presenters: Angola, Bolivia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, and Myanmar;

Second-time presenters: Bahamas, Bhutan, Chad, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Zimbabwe; and

Third-time presenters: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has indicated that no more than 42 countries will be able to present VNRs during HLPF 2021, due to time constraints.

An informal “group of friends” made up of UN Member States, established in 2019, will support the countries presenting VNRs in 2021. The group is coordinated by the delegation of Mexico to the UN.

The 2021 session of the HLPF will convene from 6-15 July under the auspices of ECOSOC. It will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ HLPF 2021 will review nine SDGs in depth:

Goal 1 (No poverty);

Goal 2 (Zero hunger);

Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing);

Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth);

Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities);

Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production);

Goal 13 (Climate action);

Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and

Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

One outcome of the HLPF is expected to be a ministerial declaration adopted at the end of the ministerial segment. At the 2020 HLPF, governments did not reach agreement on the ministerial declaration. UN Member States had attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration leading up to the HLPF, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were unable to finalize negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that if the meeting had taken place in person, governments could have voted on the draft, but “in the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was reached.

In September 2020, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, but the Council did not adopt it. ECOSOC President Munir Akram indicated that he would to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

Akram has explained that notwithstanding the lack of agreement on a Ministerial Declaration, in the HLPF discussions, Member States:

Expressed their firm commitment to a multilateral response to COVID-19;

Stressed that vulnerable countries must not be left behind in the recovery;

Called for adequate financing, debt relief and debt waivers to be provided, particularly for low- and middle-income countries; and

Acknowledged that once developed, a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone and everywhere, rich or poor, at affordable prices.

He said governments expressed that the means of implementation for the SDGs must be strengthened to meet both the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda, and the need for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited, in particular, financing, sustainable infrastructure and investment, international trade, science and technology, capacity building and partnerships.

175,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-report-analyzes-market-sustainability-trends-in-commodities-forestry/,"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"ITC Report Analyzes Market Sustainability Trends in Commodities, Forestry","The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a comprehensive report on sustainable markets that finds that a trend towards certified land is expected to continue, especially if producing countries and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, support sustainability trends. The report shares highlights and trends based on data from 14 major sustainability standards for bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and forestry products.

‘The State of Sustainable Markets 2020: Statistics and Emerging Trends,’ provides data on area, production volume, and producers for 14 standard-setting organizations focused on the eight commodities and forestry. The report finds that the certified farmland of most of the eight crops is expanding: between 2014 and 2018, the certified area of all agricultural commodities covered in the report grew by 52%. Cotton has the largest certified area: 18.2% of land cultivated for cotton globally is now certified. Cocoa, oil palm, and coffee represent the crops with the next largest areas of certified land. Commodities with the smallest certified area are soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and bananas. Buyers of most of the eight crops are also making progress in establishing and disclosing sustainable sourcing commitments.

Organic represents the biggest sustainability standard for both area and product variety. In 2018, 1.5% of agricultural land worldwide was classified as organic. In forestry, two standards dominate. The forest area certified by Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) continues to exceed the forest area certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC): 7.7% of forest area is PEFC-certified, compared with 4.9% of global forest area certified under FSC.

The report highlights the role of consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainably grown products in driving the rising popularity of certified products like bananas, cocoa, and soybeans. At the same time, ITC’s Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton cautions against depending “on consumer sentiment alone” to drive sustainability and certification. Coke-Hamilton recommends engaging with multinational buyers and policymakers to see how they can scale the uptake of sustainability standards across additional goods and countries. Additional driving forces behind growth in sustainability include implementation of risk management strategies by private companies that source commodities from developing countries, and regulatory frameworks that establish commodity sourcing conditions in both producing and consuming countries.

On COVID-19, the authors note that the pandemic has increased stress on exporters of the products analyzed in the report. Within this context, the report emphasizes that voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use more environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices while also improving their competitiveness and differentiating their product offerings.

ITC launched this fifth global report at the ITC Good Trade Summit, which took place virtually from 7-8 October on the theme, ‘Emerging Stronger from the COVID-19 Crisis.’ ITC produced the report in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), with financial support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.

The high-level event convened in the margins of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 30 September, in a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government and ministers joining virtually. The Summit focused on the theme, ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development.’

The opening segment included a “fireside chat” between the heads of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). They described biodiversity as a “shock absorber,” and said the time to “pollute our way to wealth” has passed.

Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said degradation of nature spans economics, social justice, and human rights, and can result in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Many expressed concern that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Speakers warned that biodiversity loss threatens food security, water supplies, and livelihoods, as well as our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events.

Munir Akram, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), said political will, not finance, is key to contain “economic greed” and “policy negligence.” UNGA President Volkan Bozkir called on Member States to use the Summit to build political momentum towards a post‑2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Kunming, China in 2021. “Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change,” said Bozkir, by placing the biodiversity discourse firmly on the political agenda.

A plenary session followed, during which participants highlighted the connections between biodiversity, societies, and economies.

Two Leaders’ Dialogues focused on addressing biodiversity loss and mainstreaming biodiversity for sustainable development, and on harnessing science, technology and innovation, capacity building, access and benefit-sharing (ABS), financing, and partnerships for biodiversity.

Panelists focused on ways to facilitate dialogue among researchers, policymakers, and communities to advance sustainability goals in the areas of food systems and land use, urbanization, and health.

The conference themed, ‘Science for a Sustainable Future,’ took place virtually on 8 October. Researchers came together with UN officials, government representatives, civil society leaders, experts, and policymakers to discuss how by working together we can “solve our most critical sustainable development challenges” and achieve the targets set out in the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Ahead of the conference, Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN President and Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, US, and Magdalena Skipper, Editor-in-Chief, Nature, issued a joint statement warning that our progress on the SDGs “lags far behind,” with the COVID-19 pandemic exposing the gaps between the latest scientific developments and policymaking. Highlighting “increasingly frequent zoonotic diseases,” climate change, biodiversity destruction, and “unprecedented” income and wealth inequalities among today’s challenges, the statement identifies the need to find a more inclusive path to solving problems that brings together scientists and technologists with policymakers and stakeholders, “listens across the generations,” and includes under-represented and marginalized voices.

Opening the event, Sachs said deep transformations are needed to address multiple global challenges to sustainable development and establish shared prosperity, social justice, environmental sustainability, and decent governance. He called for: technological pathways to sustainability that improve well-being and align with sustainable development; engaging natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and human sciences in an interdisciplinary manner; engaging multiple stakeholders, including science and engineering communities, policymakers, and civil society; and enabling a better informed public to be “carriers of the ethics of the common good,” informed by science.

Guido Schmidt-Traub, SDSN Executive Director moderated a panel discussion on food systems and land use.

Michael Obersteiner, University of Oxford, highlighted the need to “bend the curve” on biodiversity. He outlined the role of quantitative assessments in bringing together stakeholders and establishing trust among them. Obersteiner said bringing local implementation to the global level through knowledge networks and feedback loops is key to accelerating transitions.

Jessica Fanzo, Johns Hopkins University, described the Food Systems Dashboard that brings together data on 175 food systems indicators. She said researchers need to better communicate their findings to policymakers, with studies integrating multiple perspectives.

Jillian Campbell, CBD, highlighted the importance of building a monitoring framework for a post-2020 biodiversity framework. She stressed the need to do more to “convince the public.”

Ashish Kothari, Environmentalist and Founder of Kalpavriksh, India, emphasized the need to engage custodians of biodiversity in decision making and establish forums where hybrid knowledge systems can be built. He stressed the need for bottom-up approaches to biodiversity management and conservation.

During discussion, panelists outlined the role of data in supporting poor countries’ efforts in the land-use sector, the need for different systems of knowledge, and the need to protect biodiversity to prevent future “zoonotic spillovers.”

Mark Fischetti, Scientific American, moderated a session on urbanization. Panelists identified challenges to sustainable urbanization, provided examples of where science made a fundamental contribution, and highlighted lessons from the global South.

Chan Heng Chee, Ambassador-at-Large, Singapore, and Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at Singapore University of Technology and Design, highlighted Virtual Singapore – a three-dimensional (3D) city model tool that helps conduct virtual experiments such as planning for solar energy generation and safe cycling routes. She stressed the need to involve citizens in making cities “more livable and more lovable.”

Aromar Revi, Indian Institute for Human Settlements, identified the need to balance opportunities of urbanization against poverty and risk, and highlighted the potential of urbanization to accelerate post-COVID-19 recovery in India.

Susan Parnell, University of Bristol, urged focus on building institutions to deliver sustainable urbanization. She underscored the need to understand micro-processes and build a “cohort of people” committed to sustainable cities. Parnell warned against the “one science fits all” approach, decoupled from ethics and robust methods.

Luis Hernán Sáenz, Cómo Vamos Cities Network, Colombia, highlighted the Urban Footprint study and the Multidimensional Urban Poverty Index. He called for promoting more effective governance in line with SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) by including citizen science to leave no one behind and improve evidence-based decision making.

A panel session on health, moderated by Amy Maxmen, Nature, focused on the role of science and policy in achieving SDG health targets, and lessons learned from the COVID-19 response.

Chikwe Ihekweazu, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, called for mechanisms to push science to answer pressing questions rather than letting it “trickle down” into policymaking.

John Reeder, World Health Organization (WHO), urged researchers to provide tailored responses to the questions policymakers are asking, focusing on the specific context. He said scientists need to articulate priorities that are translatable into real public health impact.

Miriam Were, Champions for an AIDS-Free Generation, pointed to the lack of people’s perspectives in discussions on science and policymaking, and urged focus on community access to basic health services.

David Heymann, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, highlighted the importance of communicating scientific findings to those affected by their impacts.

Panelists further highlighted the need to: continue to inspire young people to choose science as a career path; and promote mentoring programs that pair researchers in industrialized and developing countries throughout the project cycle and beyond.

In closing, Skipper and Schmidt-Traub highlighted key takeaways, including the need for strong engagement with people and communities, the importance of data availability and access to improve strategies for bringing scientific communities and data users together, and the need to “cut across silos” in communicating scientific findings. Skipper said a white paper based on these outcomes will provide a set of recommendations on how to achieve better integration of science, policy, and community.

Members reviewed draft language on subsidies contributing to overcapacity and overfishing, subsidies to distant water fishing, transparency provisions, and special and differential treatment of developing and least developed countries (LDCs).

The Negotiating Group on Rules convened a cluster of meetings from 14-18 September. Participants attended meetings, technical discussions, and informal consultations, led by Negotiating Group Chair, Ambassador Santiago Wills (Colombia), in person and via virtual connections.

On overcapacity and overfishing, members discussed whether and how to ban subsidies for fishing outside one’s waters or beyond waters regulated by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Proponents argued such a provision would prevent countries from irresponsible exploitation of the high seas while others said international treaties allow fishing in areas beyond national jurisdictions (ABNJ). Some members with smaller fishing fleets said they would like “room to grow their fishing capacities.” Members also discussed how to determine which developing countries and LDCs would be allowed to maintain subsidies for fishing in their own waters, including consideration of proposed criteria such as annual catch volumes and national income to determine exemptions. Some members expressed concern that these criteria would send the “wrong message” about protection of marine health. One member suggested including a placeholder for a transition period for developing country members to comply with subsidy prohibitions.

Members also discussed whether and how to allow governments to maintain subsidies, such as for fishers to buy boats and fuel, if governments can demonstrate that they have policies in place to ensure the health of their fish stocks. Some members said this provision lowers the ambition of the agreement. Others said the mandate for the negotiations is only to eliminate subsidies where harm is observed. A few members underscored the importance of assuring the biological sustainability of the fish stock.

On notification, transparency and surveillance, eight members introduced a proposal to replace the placeholder in the Chair’s draft text. Proponents said the provision will help members check on each other’s implementation of subsidy curbs. Other members opposed replacing the text, preferring to make progress on the subsidy prohibitions first, while others reiterated concerns about the burden for developing countries that may not have the capacity to comply with notification requirements.

The Chair noted the 2020 deadline for concluding talks, acknowledging that some members had urged concluding negotiations by the end of 2020, in line with SDG target 14.6. He also recognized that other members had expressed concern about the feasibility of concluding talks by the deadline in light of the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis. The Chair said work will “continue to be organized” with the aim of continuing to work towards the end of the year deadline, as much as possible. The Chair will consult with members in the period before the next cluster of meetings, which are scheduled for 5-9 October. He concluded by praising members’ efforts towards compromise during the negotiations and agreement on how to sequence negotiations moving forward.

The white paper titled, ‘Facilitating Trade Along Circular Electronics Value Chains,’ published on 18 September 2020, looks at trade-related challenges to reverse supply chains for circular electronics, emphasizing that it is possible to use technology to improve lives while limiting harmful improper and unnecessary disposal. The authors explore trade policy solutions, including international agreement between governments, bilateral regulatory pilot projects, and public‑private initiatives.

The role that electronics play in economies and societies has become even more critical during the COVID‑19 pandemic, as they have allowed many types of work to continue by connecting workers. However, many electronics still end up in the environment or are recycled in an unsafe manner. The 2020 issue of the UN’s Global E‑Waste Monitor finds that, in 2019, 53.6 million metric tonnes of electronic waste were generated, with around 82% likely not collected and managed in an environmentally sound manner.

Challenges highlighted in the briefing note relate to: complexities of product classifications; factors leading to increases in reverse logistic costs for used products and those characterized as hazardous; and cumbersome trade‑permitting processes, particularly for products classified as hazardous. For example, reverse logistics for used electronic products were reportedly 31% more costly than outbound logistics for new products, and delays of up to 14 months for completing paperwork on hazardous products are common.

Describing solutions or potential trade facilitation actions, the paper highlights border and internal measures, transparency on domestic requirements for waste classification and movement, and policy actions including international trade instruments and regulatory cooperation between countries. For example, when electronic products are classified as hazardous under the Basel Convention, or domestically, they can face trade bans and, if transboundary movement is permitted, are subject to prior informed consent (PIC) from the import and transit countries.

The Convention’s focus on risky trade could be complemented by measures to facilitate responsible trade for the circular economy. For example, trade facilitation capacity building could help digitalize and automate the PIC procedure, and regulatory cooperation could involve fast-track systems for permits or longer validity periods.

The paper is part of a series on trade and the circular economy. A July 2020 paper in the series considers cross‑border issues in the circular economy and plastic pollution.

The briefing note is expected to contribute to a broader report on circular electronics pathways, to be released in January 2021.

The report aims to help countries align their development pathways with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies that promote climate resilience of food and water systems, energy, transport, and cities, among other sectors.

The report titled, ‘World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization,’ highlights the “huge risks” climate change poses to countries’ long-term development and growth, with critical implications for poverty, food security, and health. In a foreword, Juergen Voegele, World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, cautions that all countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, are now facing “the compound impacts of the twin challenges” of climate change and COVID-19.

The report notes that the ambition reflected in the first round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) would only limit global warming to 2.7-3.7°C above preindustrial levels. It warns that a continued focus on short- and medium-term targets could make decarbonization more difficult, and calls for long-term strategies to help countries develop sustainably. “By planning ahead, these strategies can boost new economic activity and innovations, creating the jobs of the future, while also securing a safer climate, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable,” said Mari Pangestu, World Bank’s Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, at the report’s launch.

The Outlook 2050 recognizes the need for a “bold economic transformation” to realize the vision of the Paris Agreement and make the SDGs “more achievable,” which includes aligning finance flows with low-emissions, climate-resilient development pathways. It proposes a “whole-of-economy” approach to decarbonization, which prioritizes four economy-wide strategic directions:

Embed long-term climate priorities in countries’ macroeconomic frameworks;

Embed long-term climate planning in national budgets and expenditure frameworks;

Embed long-term climate objectives in financial sector regulations and incentives; and

Embed long-term climate objectives in systems planning.

The report identifies cross-sectoral opportunities and makes recommendations across eight areas that are essential for achieving the SDGs: 1) transforming food systems; 2) protecting land-based ecosystems and carbon sinks; 3) transforming energy systems; 4) transforming mobility; 5) building low-carbon, more resilient urban areas; 6) transforming water systems; 7) transforming the ocean economy; and 8) digital transformation. The Outlook 2050 finds that investing in cross-sectoral opportunities, including as part of stimulus packages, can aid in a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report was launched on 24 June, during the ‘Kickstarting the Sustainable Recovery’ event series, organized by the World Bank’s Climate Change Group in partnership with Innovate4Climate. The series focused on the role of sustainable finance in the COVID-19 recovery to help countries “build back better and stronger.” [Publication: World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization] [Publication Landing Page] [World Bank Press Release]","The World Bank has published a report that outlines economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The Strategy was launched in June 2019 in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

The Strategy aims to enable the UN system to support the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the SDGs, the Agenda for Humanity prepared for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy will be implemented for five years and then reviewed and updated as needed.

The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.

The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.

Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”

Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.

OSM data that can be accessed through the Pacific Environment Portal, comes as a bundle of individual Geographic Information System (GIS) layers, pre-styled in a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) project, which people can use as a base map or combine with other spatial datasets.

Datasets like buildings, roads, rivers, and points of interest are available for all 14 Pacific Island countries involved in the Inform Project: the Cook Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM); Fiji; Kiribati; the Marshall Islands; Nauru; Niue; Palau; Papua New Guinea (PNG); Samoa; Solomon Islands; Tonga; Tuvalu; and Vanuatu. In addition, OSM data for seven Pacific territories will also be added: Guam; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; American Samoa; French Polynesia; New Caledonia; Tokelau; and Wallis and Futuna.

The goal is to increase awareness among Pacific GIS users of the richness of OSM data in Pacific countries, as well as potential gaps, so that they can take advantage of the tool and contribute to it by joining the OSM global community.

A representative from Kiribati highlighted the usefulness of the data. He noted that “the available OpenStreetMap data was well received by the newly established GIS Unit from the Environment and Conservation Division (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development) in Kiribati,” which “explored the use of the OSM map of Tarawa as a base map for our ongoing waste management map project, particularly for the densely populated urban areas.” “Over the course of time,” he said, “the staff plan to make some adjustments, map additions, and corrections to the OSM project, at least for Tarawa,” and highlighted the potential of the OSM project to carry “other benefits for our project reports and presentations in the future.” [IISD Knowledge Hub Sources] [Pacific Environment Portal]

The report titled, ‘The Human Cost of Disasters: An Overview of the Last 20 Years: 2000-2019,’ was issued on 13 October – the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The report serves as a reminder to countries of their commitments under the Sendai Framework, to enact national and local DRR strategies by 2020, and highlights the urgency of taking action on climate change.

The report finds that 7,348 major disaster events occurred between 2000-2019, killing 1.23 million and affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), and resulting in USD 2.97 trillion in economic losses. This represents an increase over the previous twenty-year period, during which 4,212 natural disasters killed 1.19 million and affected 3.25 billion people and caused USD 1.63 trillion in economic losses. A significant portion of the increase was driven by a rise in climate-related disasters, like extreme weather events such as floods and storms, which nearly doubled from 3,656 to 6,681. Shifting rainfall patterns and greater precipitation variability also contribute to the increase by placing the 70% of global agriculture that is rain fed, and 1.3 billion people dependent on it, at significant risk.

Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century.

The report recommends that countries improve disaster risk governance by strengthening vision, plans, guidelines, funding, and cross-sectoral coordination. While the report credits improvements to early warning systems and disaster preparedness and response for “a reduction in loss of life in single-hazard scenarios,” it highlights the “increasingly systemic nature of disaster risk.” Events’ overlap and interplay with other risk drivers, including poverty, climate change, population growth in hazard-exposed areas, uncontrolled urbanization, and biodiversity loss, expose the need to further strengthen disaster risk governance, the report notes. The report warns that inability to understand and manage systemic risk jeopardizes the achievement of the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.

To mark the International Day, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for DRR Mami Mizutori also held a public online conversation. The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote coherence between DRR and climate change adaptation in national strategies for DRR and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Espinosa stressed the need to enhance “efforts to address climate change and help build resilience to it.”

Mizutori called for “an integrated approach which recognizes the increasingly systemic nature of risk and how climate interacts with other drivers of risk.” “Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century,” she said.

Cities are responsible for 70% of global energy consumption and 80% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as participants were reminded by Christoph Heusgen, Permanent Representative of Germany.

The meeting convened on 23 October 2020 under the auspices of the Daring Cities Forum. Daring Cities is a series of virtual events aimed at “urban leaders taking on the climate emergency.” It is taking place from 7-28 October 2020.

Multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism.

Speakers discussed the ICLEI Blueprint, a proposal for “multilevel collaboration in the age of inclusive multilateralism,” in the words of Frank Cownie, Mayor of Des Moines, US, and ICLEI Vice President and spokesperson to the UN. Cownie said the Blueprint calls for local and regional governments to be at the heart of the “new UN.” The Blueprint is built on four “cornerstones”:

Global engagement through annual high-level consultations with the Chief Executives of the UN System;

Regional engagement through increased collaboration between the UN Regional Commissions and UN host cities;

National engagement with UN Country Coordinators through national associations; and

Local2030 hubs and local engagement, by mobilizing additional resources to champion local and regional governments engaged in the work of the UN.

Yunus Arikan, ICLEI World Secretariat, said the need for multilevel governance is increasingly being recognized within the UN system. Peter Lange, Foreign Federal Office, Germany, added that multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism. Stefan Wagner, City of Bonn, stressed the importance of cities’ involvement in multilateral fora, especially the UN. Sabine Drees, Association of German Cities, called for increasing the visibility of sub-national movements.

Participants exchanged views on the various roles of a voluntary local review (VLR) of SDG implementation. Maimunah Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, said VLRs are a tool to: facilitate civic engagement in local decision-making; support the mainstreaming of SDGs in local plans and strategies; guide public investments; and facilitate connections and peer learning with other cities and regions. Shipra Narang Suri, UN-Habitat, added that VLRs can mobilize and galvanize action, in addition to being a monitoring tool.

Riina Jussila, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said VLRs can also support communication between levels of government. She described VLRs a “new means of SDG implementation.”

The meeting included a focus on the City of Bonn, Germany, which released its first VLR on 6 October 2020. The Mayor of Bonn, ICLEI President Ashok Sridharan, presented the VLR to participants. He said it uses 46 indicators, and is seen as a tool to engage and communicate with stakeholders.

Local officials shared insights from Bristol, UK, Catbalogan, Philippines, and Quelimane, Mozambique. Manuel de Araujo, Mayor of Quelimane, said his city was the first in Mozambique to devise a climate adaptation plan and has since shared its experience with other cities in the country.

UN-Habitat reported that it is providing guidance to cities on developing their VLRs, beginning with Florence, Italy, and Moscow, Russian Federation.

The study provides 21 recommendations on amplifying the “substantially muted voices of women” in COVID-19 news coverage.

The study titled, ‘The Missing Perspectives of Women in COVID-19 News: A special report on women’s under-representation in news media,’ released in September 2020, focuses on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, UK, and US. It draws on a computational news content analysis of 11,913 publications and 1.9 million stories between 1 March and 15 April 2020, as well as a mix of other quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

The study finds that in the six countries analyzed, women are effectively political invisible in COVID-19-related decision-making processes. Moreover, in times of crisis, journalists may revert back to “established sources” who are significantly more likely to be men. The study finds that every individual woman’s voice in the news on COVID-19 is “drowned out by the voices of at least three, four, or five men.”

The findings reveal not just how many women are represented in COVID-19 news, but also how they are portrayed in the story. The author explains that the women who are given a platform in the COVID-19 story are “rarely portrayed as authoritative experts or as empowered individuals but more frequently as sources of personal opinion or as victims/people affected by the disease.” Women constituted 19% of experts while men constituted 77% in the 175 most highly ranked COVID-19 articles across the six countries.

In addition, few women feature as “protagonists” in COVID-19 news coverage, even less so than in news not related to COVID-19. The absence of women’s perspectives in COVID-19 news means that women have limited influence over the framing of the crisis. This results in limited influence over policymaking directions, and thus further marginalization within societies.

Recommendations to redress the bias include steps to focus on women as sources of expertise and protagonists, cover gender equality, consider the implications of the framing of stories, and seek to understand the implications of reporting on women’s lives.

The study is authored by Luba Kassova, international audience strategy consultancy AKAS Ltd. This report is the precursor to an expanded publication on the entire news value chain, commissioned in support of UN Women’s Generation Equality Forum. The expanded study will offer a gender parity checklist for news providers around the world.

Such information enables policymakers to identify the systemic loss of a country’s economic potential, and revise budgets to support prevention and protection. SDG target 5.2 calls to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.”



The report estimates that 500,000 working days are lost to marital violence annually, as women exposed to domestic violence are typically less productive and tend to take more time off, resulting in an economic loss for them and the economy as a whole. Sexual violence can result in unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages and reproductive health issues.

Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The tool features case studies from Egypt, the UK, Viet Nam and Palestine. In Egypt, the study finds that approximately 5.6 million women experience violence at the hands of their husband or fiancé annually, and the cost for women and families due to violence is approximately LE 2.17 billion. The study reports that disseminating the findings has led to increased recognition of the impact of violence against women on the entire economy and increased advocacy, resulting in:

an increase in the Ministry of Planning’s budget for violence against women-related activities;

an increase in the number of female police officers; and

development of a new draft law on violence against women that is under consideration by parliament.

The UK case study finds that the total cost of domestic violence to society is approximately £23 billion, of which £3.1 billion is borne by the state through support to the criminal justice system, health system, social services, social housing, and legal aid bills to support victims. Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The case study on Viet Nam highlights how the survey results have contributed to increased awareness of the impact of domestic violence and enhanced service provision. UN Women and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have supported the Government of Viet Nam to pilot an ‘Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence,’ which features a referral system, health care and protection. The pilot also supports the police and criminal justice system to enhance services to survivors of domestic violence. Training has increased the expertise of government personnel and researchers working on domestic violence, positioning them to undertake future costing exercises, and to feature relevant questions in national statistical surveys.

A compilation of lessons learned from the case studies highlights key recommendations for conducting costing studies, given their potential impacts: devote enough time to the preparatory phase for a costing study, including engaging the government to ensure ownership of the findings and a commitment to implement recommendations; consider the study’s scope, including clear definitions of what is included and what age range is selected; employ innovative and participatory approaches, such as a case study of a particular service or area; design the questionnaire to ensure that the methodology is culturally appropriate; produce and disseminate robust estimates; and develop an advocacy plan and use the findings at the outset, such as developing an advocacy plan to target key government leaders and engaging the media to maximize dissemination of the findings and raise awareness among the public and policymakers.

The tool proposes steps for Arab states to cost domestic violence, including considerations related to ethical guidance, site selection, data availability, and methodology and type of costs.

PEOPLE use wide a range of goods for their livelihood, comfort and amenities. The use or consumption pattern of goods varies because of changes in the way of life, predominantly contributed by economic development, technological diversity and population growth. The goods that people use for sustenance are discarded as they reach the end of their use. Waste management comes at play in protect the environment to manage the discarded goods.

The goods that people use can be divided into two principal categories: solid and liquid. Different streams of wastes originate from these two categories. Streams of wastes like perishable household wastes, construction and demolition wastes, electronic and electrical wastes, rubber, metal, glass, plastic, hazardous medical wastes, etc originate from the solid waste category. Industrial effluent, grey water, black water, paints, chemicals, etc fall in the category of liquid waste. Wastes in each of these categories and streams have the potential to damage every fabric of the environment. To prevent any harmful effects, each waste stream is handled in different ways.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are an urgent call for action by all countries, developed and developing, in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The common purpose and objective of both waste management and Agenda 2030 are to protect the environment for human benefits. The goals that the Agenda 2030 adopted for a sustainable development involve a range of functions and activities. Those functions and activities are also found in waste management. The 3R — reduce, reuse and recycle — approach in waste management is recognised globally. It encompasses a series of activities with contribution to the environment and society. For example, reuse activities create jobs, save energy, cut disposal costs, reduce the use of virgin raw materials, reduce CO2 emission, extend life of landfill and reduce pressure on land.

Waste management value addition

Goal 1 has the target to ‘end poverty in all its form everywhere’ through the development of social protection systems with targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. Waste management prevents the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbon, CO2, etc which improves environmental degradation narrowing down the risk of human vulnerability to natural disaster. Waste management also prevents the pollution of water, another area of human vulnerability.

Goal 2 eyes ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Food security is a global concern against the backdrop of the population growth and shrinking agricultural land which include cropland, forest, mangrove forest, river, lake, tea estate and salt span etc. Countries are losing agricultural land every year because of population settlement, infrastructure development, industrialisation, etc.

Food loss and waste annually contribute to 3.3 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. If a fourth of the food loss or wastes across the globe could be avoided, it could feed 750 million people. Food loss and waste affect the food supply chain, lowering income for food producers and wholesalers, increase consumer cost for food and constrain the access of low income groups to food. Minimising food loss, which waste management compliments, can improve food security and environmental gains.

Goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all in all stages. In Bangladesh, there is a large informal recycling sector in different streams of wastes. The glass recycling sector recycles about 180,000 tonnes of discarded container glasses every year. According to industry sources, the economic value of this quantity of discarded glasses at waste pickers’ level is estimated at Tk 180 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 1 a kilogram. The value of glass recyclables at the wholesaler level is estimated at Tk 450 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 2.50 a kilogram. It is estimated that annually about 96,000 tonnes of plastic waste is recycled across the country. This plastic waste has Tk 288 million in economic value at the waste picker level. Recycling has created employment for thousands of people which gives them an earning.

Goal 6 ensures an available and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Leachate percolating from decomposing waste goes into surface and ground water systems, if not protected. Given the composition and character, municipal solid waste can contain 20–50 per cent of water which it releases as it decomposes. Leachates, if not treated, contaminate ground and surface water. Besides leachate, millions of litres of black water and industry effluents from households and factories are also released into the environment. These are elements of a potential contamination of surface and ground water and it happens quietly. For example, one gallon of paint can contaminate 10 million gallons of drinking water. Waste management requires the treatment of all liquid wastes before being discharged into the environment. This requirement has a direct contribution to ‘sustainable management of water and sanitation’. There are instances that large water body such as rivers, lakes, etc get ruined when ‘waste management’ does not work.

Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Waste treatment technology producing biogas and power from waste provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces waste volume, mitigating pressure on land for waste disposal which can contribute to food security. Second, the residual of biogas can be converted into compost to use as soil stabiliser. Biogas from organic wastes or furnace oil from tyre recycling can be used as additional fuel in waste-to-energy plant where waste has low calorific value. Residuals in waste-to-energy plant, ie bottom ash, can be converted into slag and slag can be used in cement industry to produce bricks, slabs, etc, which can be used in construction works such as the preparation of road base, footpath, etc. The reuse of glass items from cullet consumes 40 per cent less energy than making new glasses from virgin raw materials on the grounds because cullet dissolves at a much lower temperature. Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 per cent. Around 900 litres of oil, a person’s two months’ water use and two people’s energy consumption for a year, can be saved by recycling just one tonne of plastic wastes.

Goal 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation. Waste management through the promotion of the reduction approach encourages industries to produce less waste in the production process where innovation is the key. Industry to sustain in the long term needs to have in-house waste management like effluent treatment plants to treat liquid wastes. Through the reuse approach, waste management promotes an extended use of product and also alternative use through recycling.

Goal 11 makes cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Human settlements in cities and towns cannot be safe with heaps of garbage on their front yard or backyard. Waste management through community activities can involve people to do their part of waste management for a safer living environment.

As countries develop, more urbanisation takes place and construction and demolition waste, a harmful component of waste stream, is on the rise. Generally, the largest part of construction and demolition material is concrete, which encompasses around 70 per cent of waste generated before recycling. There is a range of environmental and economic benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it in a landfill.

The benefits include cheaper source of aggregate, reduction in landfill space required for concrete debris, using recycled material as gravel that reduces the need for gravel mining and, increasingly, high-grade aggregate for road construction is available only at greater distances, increasing the associated economic and environmental cost impacts associated with the longer haulage distances versus using recycled aggregate.

Goal 12 targets a sustainable consumption and production pattern. Sustainable consumption and production is about the use of products and manufacturing process of products that will produce minimal waste, which invokes the 3R approach of waste management. The 3R approach minimises resource consumption in the level sufficient for basic need, which is the reduce component, use goods and materials until they can be repaired or fixed to perform its function recurrently, which is the reuse component, and reprocess the materials being discarded into new products, which is the recycle component. This approach increases resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable consumption and production. For example, it takes 1.5 tonnes of water, 22 kilograms of chemicals and 243 litres of fossil fuel to produce one computer. An extended use of a product can reduce the consumption of water, chemical and fossil fuel and also reduce waste generation. Its overall impact comes on environmental improvement.

Goal 13 encourages urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. As decay starts, waste emits methane, a greenhouse gas, impacting climate change. The emission of methane is visible in landfill during the dry season. Methane is also a cause of fire in the landfill. As waste burns, CO2 is generated. CO2 is another greenhouse gas. The contribution of the 3R approach to mitigating climate change is found in waste, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land use change and forestry sectors. In the waste sector, methane emission is reduced by gas recovery in the landfill. Energy recovered from waste reduces emissions from fossil fuel. Reduction in food loss and waste is an action in the agricultural sector to combat climate change. Food loss and waste represent the wastage of resources, including the land, water, labour, and energy resource used to produce food. It strongly contributes to climate change because greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution activities, and methane is released during the decay of food waste.

Goal 14 conserves and sustainably uses the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 6, 12 and 14 are interlinked. An uneconomical consumption of materials in production and irresponsible discharge of waste combined with absence of waste management has not ensured the availability and sustainable management of water bodies like the River Buriganga, the River Turag and the River Balu. An irresponsible discharge of plastics in the world oceans threaten marine lives.

Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manages forests, combats desertification and halts and reverses land degradation and halts biodiversity loss. Activities embedded and innovations in the 3R approach have all potentials to address the issues stated in Goal 15 on Agenda 2030.

The SDGs are for public good to improve different facets of environmental sustainability. Goals are attached to human well-being and environmental improvement through a series of activities. A wide range of activities in waste management are naturally aligned with the SDGs. An improved waste management directly complements the achievement of the SDG. While 11 of the 17 goals get direct contribution, 6 receives indirect support from waste management.

Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

Arena openings across SDG have it looking more like fall

Article content LONG SAULT — It’s starting to look a lot more like fall and winter sports and recreation season in Williamstown, Long Sault and other parts of the region. Long Sault Arena reopened late in September, after being closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And, on Monday the township announced public skating and stick-and-puck at the arena returns this season – and will be free of charge. The schedule of sessions is set to begin on Oct. 14, and online registration will be required, as there are limited spots available. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Arena openings across SDG have it looking more like fall Back to video There’ll be four public skating sessions per week, including two on Sundays (11-11:50 a.m., 3-3:50 p.m.). There’ll also be free public skating on Mondays (10-10:50 a.m.) and Thursdays (10-10:50 a.m). The Benson Centre in Cornwall in July was the first facility in the region to have an ice pad available, and the Township of South Glengarry recently reopened the ice surface at the Char-Lan Recreation Centre in Williamstown, with numerous safety measures in place.

Article content “We’ve implemented important safety measures in direct consultation with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit under Stage 3,” said Rick Ladouceur, director of recreation and facilities, in a township news release. “We’re all in this together and want to ensure everyone has a safe return to the ice this season. The upgrades and guidelines we’ve implemented will help accomplish this.” Facility users are being greeted with a sign-in process upon entry to maintain contact tracing security. There’s freshly painted spectator seating areas, distanced and marked appropriately to maintain a two-metre distance, and high-standard electro-sanitation packs are being used between each reservation. Recreation co-ordinator Cathy McDonell in the news release said township staff have “worked diligently these past few months in preparation of welcoming back the community. . . we’re excited to finally have our doors re-open, and are currently accepting reservations for icetime bookings in (the remainder of October).” In early September, North Glengarry announced its two arenas – the Glengarry Sports Palace in Alexandria, and the Maxville & District Sports Complex – would have staggered openings, with an anticipated early October opening in Alexandria, followed later in the fall by the sports complex. The Alexandria Minor Hockey Association has also taken to the ice – the Glens’ first group will be the U-17 level, who had time scheduled late on Wednesday afternoon.

Article content Procedures that need to be followed will include all players arriving at the arena fully dressed, except for skates, gloves and helmets. And, due to the limit of 50 people in the stands, only one parent per child will be admitted to the facility. In South Dundas, the Morrisburg Arena re-opened late last week. The municipality prepared a video that highlighted the regulations that are in place during the pandemic, and the complete operations plan is also available. Ice time can be booked by calling the arena, and there are also numerous free public skating sessions, including moms, tots and seniors on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 10:30-11:30 a.m. each of the two days. The municipality also had announced registration is open for fall recreation programming, which includes yoga, kickboxing, and high-intensity interval training, at the Iroquois Civic Centre and Matilda Hall. In North Dundas, the ice season that got underway in late September got busier this week in Winchester and Chesterville, with the Family Stick and Puck Program. There are sessions in Winchester on Monday and Saturday afternoons, and in Chesterville on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons.

194,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-shows-sdg-data-trends-with-interactive-atlas/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Illustrates SDG Data Trends with Interactive Atlas,"The World Bank has released the 2020 edition of its SDG Atlas. This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

195,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-synthesizes-messages-from-47-vnrs-presented-in-2020/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,DESA Synthesizes Messages from 47 VNRs Presented in 2020,"The UN has released a synthesis report of the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) conducted in 2020. A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

The 2020 Leaders’ Summit focused on the theme, ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All by Empowering People, Safeguarding the Planet, and Shaping New Frontiers.’

The ‘G20 Riyadh Summit’ convened virtually from 21-22 November. The Saudi G20 Presidency focused on issues including structural inequalities and debt repayments at a time when resources are needed to address the pandemic and ensure sustainable development.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G20 Leaders commit to leading the world in shaping a “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-COVID-19 era,” and emphasize the importance of “coordinated global action, solidarity and multilateral cooperation” to overcome current challenges and realize opportunities for all by “empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.” The Declaration focuses on four areas:

rising to the challenge together to address the pandemic, including through implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI;

building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, including points on health, trade and investment, and other financial topics;

ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities, including points related to sustainable development, access to opportunities, employment, women’s empowerment, education, tourism, and migration and forced displacement; and

ensuring a sustainable future, through work on environment, energy and climate, agriculture, and water.

A G20 press release notes that the G20 DSSI will provide the poorest and most vulnerable countries with “urgent and immediate liquidity relief from official bilateral creditors.” The Initiative provides USD 14 billion in 2020 to tackle the pandemic and its economic and social impacts. In addition, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working to provide US 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries between April and December 2020, as part of a broader USD 230 billion package for low-income and emerging countries. According to the release, G20 countries have also provided USD 21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, and over USD 1 trillion to support the global economy.

On building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, leaders addressed, inter alia:

the importance of tackling health and global pandemic preparedness, prevention, detection and response and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases based on a One Health approach;

trade and investment, including endorsing the G20 Actions to Support World Trade and Investment on the Future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recognizing the contribution of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO in allowing an additional opportunity to discuss and reaffirm the objectives and principles of the multilateral trading system (MTS) and to demonstrate ongoing political support for WTO reform. Leaders further recognize the need to increase the sustainability and resilience of supply chains to foster the integration of developing and least developed countries (LDCs) into the trading system and to promote inclusive economic growth, including through increased participation of micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in international trade and investment;

transportation and travel, including ensuring that global transportation routes and supply chains remain open, safe and secure;

international finance architecture, including a commitment to continue the process of International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform and an invitation to the IMF to prepare an analysis of external financing needs in low-income developing countries in future years, outlining sustainable options;

financial sector issues, such as a commitment to the Financial Stability Board’s principles underpinning national and international responses to COVID-19 and a work plan to improve the resilience of the non-bank financial sector;

digital economy, recognizing that universal, affordable, and secure connectivity is a key enabler for the digital economy and a catalyst for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and innovation;

international taxation; and

anti-corruption, including welcoming the first G20 Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting and endorsing the G20 Call to Action on Corruption and COVID-19.

On ensuring a sustainable future, leaders committed to safeguarding the planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all, including through conserving the marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Leaders launched the Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to conserve coral reefs and the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. They reaffirmed commitment to reduce marine plastic litter and to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Leaders further recognized the importance of expediting universal access to affordable and reliable energy for all, and endorsed the Circular Carib Economy Platform.

Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities.

Addressing the Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres outlined three key areas where G20 leadership is key to building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future:

halting the further spread of the pandemic;

mobilizing the resources to build forward better; and

aligning recovery efforts with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.

He said we have a “moral obligation” to ensure that the trillions of dollars “we are borrowing from future generations” for COVID‑19 recovery “does not leave them burdened by a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

In an address, WTO Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff identified three challenges facing WTO members: using trade to boost the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; facilitating trade in essential medical products needed to treat the pandemic; and reforming institutions that govern global trade, including restoring the WTO’s deliberative and negotiating functions and providing binding dispute settlement. He said a trade finance initiative should be seen as an essential part of economic recovery, and urged the G20 to support WTO action on economic recovery, pandemic response, and WTO reform.

The G20 brings together some of the largest economies, amounting to around 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic global issues. The G20 consists of 19 countries and the EU. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Turkey, the UK, and the US. In 2020, Spain, Jordan, Singapore, and Switzerland were invited as guest countries.

It provides practical information on steps that countries may take when preparing VNRs, presenting the VNR report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and following up after the HLPF.

VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Conducted voluntarily by national governments, the reviews are intended to track progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs at the country level, and comprise part of the follow-up and review of the Agenda. Since 2016, 205 VNRs have been presented by 168 countries. For the 2021 session, 43 countries are expected to present a VNR.

The 2021 VNR handbook was released in November 2020 as an updated version of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 editions. The 2021 edition recommends that countries include a section on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDG implementation, measures undertaken to ensure a sustainable, green recovery, and impacts on VNR preparations.

The handbook notes that the ten countries conducting their first VNR will be allocated 30 minutes. These countries are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and San Marino.

The 33 countries presenting second and third VNRs will present them in a panel format with 20 minutes each during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF. Twenty-four countries are conducting their second reviews: Bahamas, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, Chad, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Namibia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Nine countries are conducting their third reviews: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The handbook makes specific recommendations for countries preparing a VNR for the second or third time, including that countries should show progress made since their first VNR, and avoid repeating information presented in a previous VNR. The handbook encourages countries to address how they overcome challenges in SDG implementation and share lessons learned and good practices adopted.

On UN support for countries’ VNR preparations, the handbook notes that DESA is organizing three global workshops for working-level officials closely engaged in the national preparatory process, as follows:

October-November 2020: A virtual workshop to facilitate peer learning and exchange between countries conducting VNRs in 2021 and those that have previously carried out VNRs, as well as to cover key components of the preparatory process;

Spring 2021: In-depth exchanges on the preparation and presentation process, drafting sections of the VNR report, and presenting the VNR report; and

On 11 July 2021 in New York, US, a workshop covering final preparatory matters and addressing anticipated follow-up to the VNRs.

In addition, the five UN Regional Commissions are expected to organize workshops on the margins of their respective regional sustainable development fora to discuss regional specificities and lessons learned by previous VNR countries.

On deadlines, governments must submit main messages – the principal findings of the review – by 2 May 2021. The final VNR report is due on 11 June 2021.

The handbook concludes with suggestions for concrete follow-up steps after the HLPF. These include: presenting outcomes of the VNR presentation at the HLPF in a press conference; debriefing the VNR project team on the outcomes of the HLPF presentation; and sharing the VNR at the regional level. Further, the handbook suggests that countries promote concrete action on priorities contained in the VNR, such as through convening a cabinet meeting to consider VNR follow-up, and developing an action plan or road map that addresses the “who, what, where and when” of priority actions.

The 2021 HLPF is scheduled to convene from 6-15 July.

The briefing focused on two recent reports from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Presentations included remarks from the UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, a role established 25 years ago due to growing concern about the dumping in Africa of hazardous waste generated in Europe.

Held on 20 October 2020, the briefing provided an opportunity to discuss: a report on issues of concern, detailing eight emerging policy issues and other issues of concern identified under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), and reviewing how regulatory and policy frameworks address them; and a report on strengthening the science-policy interface for chemicals and waste management, which assesses three options for such an interface: an independent platform; institutionalizing outlook development processes; and thematic subsidiary panels with specialized task forces. UNEP developed the reports in response to requests by the fourth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) for consideration at UNEA-5.

Marcos Orellana, UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, said the science-policy interface is particularly important regarding human rights implications of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. He said the “right to science” in the human rights field is anchored in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

He said criteria for a successful SPI in this area include credibility and independence, as well as transparency to prevent conflict of interest. He also highlighted the private sector’s role in the work of existing science-policy platforms in chemicals and waste, as well as the need to protect against inappropriate corporate influence. Orellana said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): preserves the integrity of the scientific debate; keeps discussions transparent; and enables access to the scientific evidences in which the assessments are based.

In response to questions from participants, Orellana also discussed disclosure of information by manufacturers. He highlighted: the complexity of balancing the benefits of scientific progress with intellectual property rights (IPRs); the need for governments to establish regulatory mechanisms to ensure access to information; and risks that platforms may be captured by special interests.

Felix Wertli, Switzerland, said the most effective SPI option for Switzerland is an intergovernmental panel, which would best prevent conflicts of interest and ensure scientific integrity. Speakers also pointed out that:

The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS) have embedded SPI mechanisms, such as the POPs Review Committee under the Stockholm Convention, and expert working groups, for example on plastic and on e-waste, under the Basel Convention;

Digital tools are important to maximize the impact of SPI platforms; and

Virtual working groups have been established during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure discussions continue on the post-2020 framework for chemicals and waste management.

Discussions also addressed the current model of the Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO), adopted at UNEA, and its deficiencies regarding strengthening the SPI.

Participants raised the need to strike a balance in the post-2020 instrument, including regarding funding, between the high-level, research/policy-oriented aspects and on-the-ground efforts on issues of concern. Exchanges also touched on technology transfer and institutional strengthening in developing countries, including through UNEP’s Special Programme on Institutional Strengthening for the Chemicals Cluster, which helps developing countries access funding and develop sound plans for managing chemicals and waste.

The first of its kind, the webinar focused on the theme, ‘The Future of Trade and Environment: Interactions with Geneva’s Youth.’

The event was held in the context of the WTO Trade and Environment Week. Gergana Kiskinova and Romain Williams, WTO, moderated the discussion.

The event began with opening remarks from two ambassadors, who provided background to the event and shared perspectives on the role of young people in international discussions taking place in Geneva.

Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and Chair of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), stated that the current generation of young people will face major environmental challenges. Emphasizing challenges posed by unsustainable consumption patterns and single-use plastics, he urged young people to decide what kind of future they want and look at how they can both create and protect it. Blackman encouraged all schools in Geneva to be champions of environment and sustainability to enable Geneva’s young people to become world leaders in climate change awareness and plastic-free zones.

Bettina Waldmann, Ambassador of Germany to the WTO, recognized that this generation is “very much aware of the ecological challenges we face.” She highlighted the importance of greater engagement among trade diplomats and youth. Recognizing that global trade has an impact on our ecological system, Waldmann said the WTO “can and will be” part of the solution. She further noted the EU Plastics Strategy, which addresses plastic pollution, covering the material’s entire lifecycle.

Students from the German School of Geneva gave a presentation on the problem of plastic waste, using Barbados as an example for Europe to follow. They outlined how Barbados gradually phased out single-use plastics over time rather than introducing a complete ban overnight. The students called for efforts to halve plastic waste by 2050, and mentioned plant starch as an alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics.

Students from Institut Florimont delivered a presentation on trade in goods and the role of clean transport. While global trade in goods is made possible by multiple forms of transport, they said freight is responsible for 7% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Among solutions, the students mentioned greater investment in green transport and shifting to consumption of more local goods.

Karsten Steinfatt, WTO, applauded the realism and ambition from the students. He pointed out that the WTO takes into consideration the entire lifecycle of products, and products that come from far away do not always have a bigger carbon footprint. Steinfatt said it is necessary to inform consumers to help them choose the most environmentally friendly products. He also emphasized that the WTO does not advocate “trade for trade’s sake,” but rather prioritizes “good trade,” beneficial for the economy as well as the environment.

After some dialogue between the ambassadors and the students, Brianna Kerr, Director and Head of Impact at Kua, Sydney, Australia, delivered the last presentation. She introduced Kua – a student-created company that sources ethical coffee from smallholder farms in Uganda. Prioritizing a circular model, Kua rethinks waste by collecting customers’ coffee grounds and distributing them to local farms in the Sydney area. The company uses its profits to fund climate resilience projects in Uganda. Kerr hoped to open source Kua’s business model so that other social entrepreneurs could replicate it in their countries.

The ambassadors then offered concluding remarks. Waldmann wished to continue conversations with youth in future WTO Trade and Environment Weeks, and stated that the German Mission is ready to sponsor upcoming events.

Blackman hoped the event would become a permanent fixture of future Trade and Environment Weeks, and expressed readiness to work with young people in Geneva to take their ideas forward through a Geneva-based network of youth interested in trade and environment.

In an attempt to capture some progress and further focus the negotiations, the Chair of the WTO negotiating group in charge of fisheries talks, Ambassador Wills of Colombia, introduced a revised version of the draft consolidated text he had initially circulated to WTO Members in July. The text, however, was not discussed in detail by negotiators.

Delegations also considered a range of pending issues to narrow down differences, including: the duration of a possible subsidy prohibition for actors engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; unassessed stocks; dispute settlement and remedies; and special and differential treatment for developing countries. Gaps between WTO members’ positions, however, remain significant on a number of key topics.

A number of new proposals were also presented last week. These include a proposal from the Philippines on dispute settlement in cases where territoriality is disputed; a “discussion text” from Chinese Taipei on dispute settlement procedures; and a proposal from four landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) – Afghanistan, Mongolia, Nepal, and Paraguay – concerning transit transportation of fish and technical assistance. A new proposal by Brazil proposing quantitative limits to the total amounts of subsides WTO member would be allowed to disburse was discussed intersessionally between the two last meeting clusters.

While progress has been achieved in negotiations in recent months, delegates and observers alike warn that clinching a deal by the talks’ 2020 deadline enshrined in SDG target 14.6 will require a quick and significant intensification of negotiations. Last week, a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) launched a global campaign titled, ‘Stop Funding Overfishing,’ to support the conclusion of a meaningful WTO agreement by the end of the year. The campaign’s policy statement, which has been signed by 169 organizations from around the world, including leading environmental NGOs, such as WWF, Greenpeace, Oceana, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), calls on governments around the world to “fulfil their commitment to curb the public money that supports overfishing and degrades our ocean.”

The last meeting cluster of 2020 is planned for the week starting on 30 November.

A Step Forward

The revised draft consolidated text presented last week updates the first version of the draft consolidated text presented by the negotiations’ Chair on 25 June 2020. All WTO members accepted this text as a basis for further discussion, a step that was widely perceived as a significant sign of progress. For the first time in more than a decade, negotiators are focusing on one single negotiating document and proposing amendments to it based on common concepts.

Most key delegations have also reportedly started to think in terms of possible options for compromise and flexibilities. While this has not led to tangible headway in terms of substance yet, this change of dynamics is perceived as a necessary step towards concluding a deal.

The revised draft consolidated text presented by the Chair last week is an attempt to move in that direction. It contains a number of revisions of varying degrees of importance as well as a number of additions, in particular to replace some of the placeholders that were included in the first version of the text.

“I am confident that all delegations will find things to like in the changes that I am proposing, and that this revision thus will represent a step forward in the evolution of our work toward that full consensus,” the Chair said when introducing the document, according to the WTO Secretariat.

What’s in the Revised Draft Consolidated Text?

In essence, WTO negotiators are currently considering new subsidy disciplines in three substantive areas: (1) subsides to IUU fishing; (2) subsidies to the fishing of stocks that are already in an overfished condition; and (3) subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity more broadly.

No major changes were introduced in the new text regarding the rules related to IUU fishing and overfished stocks. In the case of IUU fishing, the most notable revision is simplification of the language that describes the conditions a determination of IUU fishing would have to meet in order to trigger a prohibition to subsidise a vessel or operator. The revised text states that an IUU finding would need to be based on positive evidence and follow due process, without specifying the steps required.

The most significant modification concerns the possible qualitative prohibition of subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. The previous version of the text stated that subsidies that reduce the operating costs and capital costs of fishing would be prohibited in specific situations where fishing capacity or effort is excessive. The revised text simply lists a number of subsidy types that would be prohibited, including subsidies for fuel, boat construction and modernization, or price support.

This simplification increases the potential reach of the prohibition, but is closely linked to another change made to an exception to this rule. To benefit from this revised exception and continue to provide subsidies, WTO members would need to show that they implement measures to maintain relevant stocks at sustainable levels. The revised exception drops the requirement that such fisheries management measures be effective, meaning that it would likely be easier for members to invoke the exception to continue to subsidize fishing.

In order to clarify which marine species the proposed agreement would apply to, the revised text also introduces a definition of “fish,” which, like other key definitions, has been taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures. This constitutes an attempt by the Chair to move forward on an issue some members feel required a disproportionate amount of time during the previous meeting cluster in October.

The Chair also proposed new text to replace three placeholders relating to: transparency and notification requirements, with specific information to be notified still to be defined; institutional arrangements; and dispute settlement.

Finally, the revised Chair’s text includes a new exception for subsidies for disaster relief – a general idea around which there seemed to be convergence during the October meeting cluster – under certain conditions.

Quick Intensification Needed to Meet 2020 Deadline

Despite positive signs in the dynamics of fisheries talks in recent months, significant efforts will be needed from delegations to overcome their differences on various parts of the disciplines. Recent work by IISD highlights that a number of important decisions will need to be made by WTO members in order to successfully reach an agreement.

One of the key questions for negotiators relates to the issue of special and differential treatment (S&D) for developing countries, a notoriously sensitive topic in the context of WTO negotiations. The topic is underlined in the negotiations’ mandate and in SDG target 14.6, which specifies that “appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.”

Last week’s cluster of meetings highlighted the divergence of views on this topic. Ambassador Didier Chambovey of Switzerland, recently appointed “Friend of the Chair” to facilitate S&D discussions, said members’ positions remain “quite far apart.”

While some members would like S&D provisions to exempt developing countries from parts of the main subsidy prohibitions, others think that new disciplines should instead provide only for transition periods and technical assistance for implementation. Ambassador Chambovey called on delegations to be pragmatic, creative, and flexible to find acceptable solutions that could gather consensus.

With only weeks before the start of the last meeting cluster on fisheries subsidies in 2020, S&D is only one of the numerous questions still outstanding in WTO fisheries talks. To be able to clinch a deal by the 2020 deadline, WTO members will need to intensify efforts in the coming weeks and to demonstrate they have the political will to reach compromise on these various issues.

The future vitality of the world’s forests, and the globally significant environmental services they provide, are increasingly under threat from human activities. Deforestation and forest degradation have negative impacts on biodiversity and hydrological services, and contribute to climate change.

Current Global Framework for Forest Loss

Global forest loss is addressed under a range of international agreements and conventions, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has specific provisions for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries).

In 2007, the international community recognized the importance of forests and land use as a key area for climate change mitigation when the Bali Action Plan called for policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries. In the wake of this important milestone, the year 2008 saw the launch of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and the UN-REDD Programme, under which countries work through a readiness process towards participation in REDD+. At the 2013 UN Climate Change Conference, countries approved the Warsaw Framework, which detailed the requirements for country participation in REDD+, notably including the requirements for forest reference (emission) level submissions, the benchmarks for assessing each country’s REDD+ performance.

Results of Countries’ REDD+ Efforts

Since the Warsaw Climate Change Conference in 2013, countries have made tremendous progress in preparing for, implementing, and reporting on their REDD+ actions. An FAO publication launched on 28 October 2020, titled From reference levels to results reporting: REDD+ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – 2020 update, provides an update of the results achieved so far. Let’s take a closer look at progress as of September 2020.

Fifty countries submitted 60 FREL/FRLs to the UNFCCC for technical assessment. These forest reference (emission) level (FREL/FRL) submissions collectively cover a forest area of approximately 1.35 billion ha (33% of global forest area).The countries that submitted a REDD+ FREL/FRL to the UNFCCC are responsible for around 75% of global deforestation (according to FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment). In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL.

In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL. Thirteen countries reported REDD+ results to the UNFCCC through 17 results submissions (in the REDD+ technical annex of their biennial update reports). Results have been reported for all REDD+ activities, although no single country covered all REDD+ activities. The majority of all reported results came from reducing emissions from deforestation (98%). The combined REDD+ results reported total 9.03 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil.

The majority of all reported results came from reducing emissions from deforestation (98%). The combined REDD+ results reported total 9.03 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil. The UNFCCC published 45 FREL/FRL technical assessment reports, and 14 technical analysis reports of REDD+ results. For 43 of the 45 finalized technical assessments (96%), countries had submitted a modified FREL/FRL, and 33 of these 43 modified FREL/FRL submissions (77%) changed the FREL/FRL value as a result of the technical assessment. The reporting process triggers methodological improvements that help countries move towards more robust sample-based approaches. With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency.

The reporting process triggers methodological improvements that help countries move towards more robust sample-based approaches. With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency. Finally, six funding proposals for REDD+ results-based payments were approved by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The fund approved results-based payment proposals from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Paraguay totaling USD 361 million.

The most frequently mentioned objective in reference level submissions is to gain access to results-based finance. In 2017, the GCF launched the pilot program for results-based payment with a total envelope of USD 500 million.

To date, six countries have been awarded results-based payments, with two more countries (Argentina and Costa Rica) planning to present their proposals at the GCF board meeting in November 2020.

Moving Forward Amid COVID-19

Building on the considerable amount of work on REDD+ over the past decade, significant progress has been observed in recent years. Initiatives like UN-REDD Programme, the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) have played important roles.

However, with the unexpected challenges that 2020 has brought us, we need to ensure that we stay on track. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, moving REDD+ forward will be more important than ever, as the pandemic may result in even greater pressure on forest resources. REDD+ actions are here not only to avoid potential negative post-COVID realities, they are here to prevent similar catastrophes. The pandemic sweeping across the world is a crisis in which human activities have played a key role. It is up to us to ensure that it does not further negatively impact our planet.

We also need to work with countries to ensure that forest monitoring efforts result in quality forest data, which can drive higher ambitions for forests and the climate. This is fundamental to ensure the integrity of the REDD+ process and for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 2020 update highlights efforts to incorporate recycled content into plastic packaging and phase out single-use plastic bags and straws. The authors call for an international framework on plastic pollution.

The 2020 progress report towards the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment finds that “much more must be done, and at greater speed” to tackle plastic pollution and achieve the 2025 targets of the Commitment. Although progress has been made on incorporating recycled content in plastic packaging and phasing out the most commonly identified items, like single-use plastic bags and straws, PS and PVC packaging, and undetectable carbon black pigments, there has been limited progress in other areas. Progress is limited on shifting towards reusable packaging and increasing the recyclability of plastic packaging. On eliminating the need for single-use packaging, efforts have focused on a small set of formats and materials, and substituting other plastics or paper rather than reducing the need for single-use packaging.

The report finds “substantial differences in progress between signatories” to the Commitment towards their 2025 targets on a circular economy for plastics. For example:

The Coca-Cola Company is 99% of the way towards achieving its 2025 packaging design target;

Of the signatories for packaged goods and retail, 31% have established targets to reduce virgin plastic in packaging or eliminate plastic packaging;

On reuse, 39% of signatories are testing and piloting models, including a few that reported large numbers of pilots: Natura Cosmetics (24), L’Oreal (22), Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (10) and Unilever (9); and

Other signatories have shown little to no progress on quantitative targets; the report states many businesses will need to accelerate their efforts to meet their 2025 targets.

The report concludes with four calls to action for businesses and governments. Businesses are urged to: take bold action on packaging types that are not recycled today, either decisively innovating away from them or developing and implementing a roadmap to make recycling work; and set ambitious reduction targets that recognize that “voluntary action by industry alone” will not be sufficient.

The authors call on governments to: set global direction and create an international framework for action through the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA), building on the vision of a circular economy for plastics; and establish mechanisms and policies that provide dedicated, stable funding for collection and sorting, including through fair industry contributions, as recycling is “unlikely to ever scale” without such action.

The 2020 report uses 2019 data; the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet reflected in the numbers in the report. The report observes that the pandemic “has without doubt had an impact on the plastics system in 2020” and future reports are expected to report on this impact.

They are transforming their food systems based on their priorities and capacities to fulfill, in particular, the 2030 SDG Goal 2 that aims to “end hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture.” There are crucial gaps, however, and the BIMSTEC states need transformative action to overcome them.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

“The global coronavirus pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt,” he said. “The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe.”

The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, certainly seems to agree with Defoe (see below) that the world should now look on things with “differing eyes”.

“Another plague would remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes, than those which we looked on things with before.”

These are the words of Daniel Defoe in A Journal of the Plague Year, a vivid account of life in London in 1665 when bubonic plague wiped out 15 percent of the city’s population, and brought the economy of the whole of England to a standstill.

Many of those who didn’t die, lost their livelihoods, and just as in the global pandemic of 2020, after a period of fear, isolation and hysteria, the great and pressing concern was how to build a better world from the devastation. Defoe’s graphic description of the plague, and the subsequent economic ruin has distinct echoes for our times.

Some economists are forecasting a V-shape recovery; a fast bounce-back. But many more suggest the most likely outcome will be an L-shaped impact – a rapid dip followed by a long period of no significant growth, perhaps continuing for many years.

The United Nations, in its response to the pandemic is perhaps facing the greatest test since its inception in 1945. But the organisation is determined not to be blown off course in its pledge to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

The task of finding a way through this world-wide catastrophe has fallen to 71 year old Mr Guterres who became Secretary-General of the UN in 2017 having served two terms as Prime Minister of his native Portugal. The leader of the country’s Socialist Party, he was widely admired at home and abroad for his support for humanitarian causes. He began his career at the UN as High Commissioner for Refugees where he became convinced that sustainable development would be essential for the eradication of poverty and inequality.

Since his appointment as Secretary-General, he has enthusiastically championed the UN’s blueprint of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to achieve “a better and more sustainable future for all”. These include an end to poverty and hunger, promotion of good health and education, gender equality, clean water provision, clean energy and action on climate change.

This holistic response to the root causes of conflicts – integrating peace, sustainable development and human rights – was going to be challenging enough without an unforeseen global crisis like the Covid-19 virus.

The UN had hoped to achieve their SDG aims by the end of the decade, but the pandemic has thrown a giant spanner in the works, threatening destabilisation in many of the developing countries of the world, most notably in Africa, where progress was being made towards the SDG target.

Mr Guterres, attending a virtual high-level UN the meeting aimed at finding solutions to tackle the damage done by the pandemic to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, warned that Covid-19 would cause “unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world”. He predicted that millions would be pushed into extreme poverty, that there would be famines of “historic proportions”, and that we would witness the sharpest contraction of the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis – because of a microscopic virus,” he said.

He said that there must be immediate, collective action in six crucial areas: Global liquidity and solutions to debt; incentives for creditors; incentives to boost sustainable development; a crackdown on illicit financial dealings; the alignment of incentives in global financial systems with SDGs to boost confidence and relaunch investment in sustainable development; and finally, the creation of an over-arching global framework to aid rapid recovery.

“All our efforts must go towards building sustainable and resilient pathways that enable us not only to beat Covid-19, but to tackle the climate crisis, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty and hunger,” he said.

“Getting through Covid-19 and recovering better will cost money, but the alternative will cost far more. This is a global crisis and it’s up to all of us to solve it. Let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future.”

Mr Guterres has been at pains to insist that in the pursuit of sustainable economic recovery world governments must build upon the UN’s SDG blueprint. There was a triple imperative, he told the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in May, to stem the pandemic, safeguard development gains already made, and ensure that all recovery efforts followed the SDG 2030 Agenda.

“Working together, with our foot on the pedal and our eyes on the (SDG) 2030 Agenda, we will get through this crisis and reach our destination, protecting hard-won development progress and accelerating our joint efforts,” he said. “Our objective remains clear; to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.”

One element of the SDGs is gender equality, and Mr Guterres singled out the role of women in the world economy. The pandemic, he said, had laid bare the extent to which national economies are sustained by the unpaid domestic labour of women. He urged governments to tackle the issue in the post-pandemic world to ensure a better recovery. “Returning to our previous path is simply not an option,” he said.

His words were echoed by ECOSOC president, Mona Juul, who said that the pandemic had exposed the disproportionate burden on women who perform unpaid care work and are overrepresented as frontline health workers. She said that the inclusion of a gender perspective, as enshrined in SDG, into social and economic responses to the virus was essential.

Mr Guterres emphasised that bold action taken now, based on the UN’s SDGs, would not only protect the weakest, it would help ensure a stronger recovery. And he again stressed the regularly-quoted phrase that he would “leave no-one behind”. The recovery, he said, had to be focussed on building inclusive and sustainable economies that are more resilient in the face of future global challenges.

At the beginning of the year, the UN announced a “Decade of Action” for SDGs. The conversation at the time was about how to build momentum in the final ten years of the initiative. In its 2019 SDG report, the UN had warned that progress towards the goals was slowing, even reversing in some areas.

Now there are many who paradoxically believe the pandemic, far from being an unanticipated obstacle to SDG progress, may help reinvigorate the project. The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), for instance, pointed to the way many businesses supported communities and the vulnerable during the pandemic, showing a willingness to help society and go above and beyond the normal.

UKSSD blogger, Emily Auckland, said: “It is only by working together that we will create a post-pandemic future that is fairer, just and sustainable.”

Failure to respond quickly at this point in history, said Mr Guterres, could jeopardise progress already made towards achieving SDGs. The UN has drawn attention to several areas where a substantially improved outcome might be achieved because of the effects of the pandemic – one being the question of remittances.

Remittances – the money sent by migrant workers in developed nations to their families in poorer countries – currently account for more than five percent of GDP in as many as 60 low-income countries. During the pandemic, this flow of cash has been dramatically reduced, causing great hardship in developing countries.

But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the global remittance system, said Gilbert F. Houngbo, president of the UN agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He called for an overhaul of money-transfer systems to ensure more of the cash reaches needy families, and less is lost in transfer fees. IFAD is currently in negotiation with financial technology firms, mobile operators, banks and postal networks to find a solution to high transaction costs.

Mr Guterres focussed specifically on the effects upon mental health as a result of the pandemic, especially among the young. “Mental health is at the core of our humanity,” he said. “The virus is not only attacking our physical health, it is also increasing psychological suffering. Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief and anxiety will continue to affect people and communities.”

His observations were confirmed in late May 2020, when the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warned that more than one in six young people worldwide had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus.

The ILO reported that under 30s had been particularly hard hit, claiming that their financial prospects could be blighted for decades. Guy Ryder, the ILO’s Director-General said that many young people would simply be left behind. Youth unemployment in the EU for instance, which still stands at around 15 percent, had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, he said.

This was just one aspect of the potential fall-out from the pandemic. Mr Guterres also drew attention to the plight of the world’s developing nations, especially those in Africa, whose progress towards the UN’s SDG targets was being thrown off course as a result of the economic damage caused by coronavirus.

Mr Guterres had earlier called on UN member states to adopt a “war economy” to fight the effects of the virus. Defeating coronavirus, he said, was the first stage, but the world should seize the opportunity to create a global economy which was more “inclusive and sustainable going forward”.

“We need to prepare for a recovery for a better economy, a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” he said. “We don’t need to replicate exactly the economy of the past. Many things will change, I would say irreversibly in our lives.”

He said that the world needed to use the current situation wisely; “to seize it as an opportunity” to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability in national economies. He also expressed the hope that another effect of the pandemic would be to force governments to re-evaluate relationships with the environment, and redouble efforts to combat climate change.

Unsurprisingly for a man who sees his fundamental role as UN Secretary-General to be the achievement of the eradication of poverty and inequality, Africa is at the heart of his Covid-19 concerns.

As the virus began to spread across the continent, Mr Guterres called on warring factions in several African states to agree to a general ceasefire, in the hope that the pandemic would somehow make peace easier to achieve.

Mr Guterres knows that the pandemic will not be defeated until Africa is safe. Economic instability could lead to catastrophic collapse in the region, leading in turn to more conflict, famine and an upsurge in migration.

“In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people,” he said. “Economic growth has been strong; the digital revolution has taken hold. A free trade area has been agreed. But the epidemic threatens Africa’s progress. It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.”

It was already the case, he said, that African exports were in serious decline because of coronavirus, and demand in the continent’s tourism industry had all but dried up. The opening of a pan-African trade zone, upon which so much is staked, and which was due to take place in 2020, has been postponed as a direct result of the pandemic.

Mr Guterres praised the way African countries had moved rapidly to establish regional co-operation to fight the spread of the disease, including co-ordinated quarantines and lockdowns. He also commended African governments for drawing on their experience of epidemics like HIV/Aids and Ebola in the fight against rumour and misinformation, debunking anecdotal speculations and overcoming mistrust of government agencies.

But the international community, he argued, had to step in to help strengthen local health systems, and try to avoid a financial crisis which could push millions of Africans into poverty.

Elsewhere, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shone the spotlight on the effect of the pandemic on environmental issues, insisting that the world’s response must not be seen as simply a philanthropic reaction. Sustainable recovery and development will need to be fully future-proofed, she said. The threat posed by rising global temperatures increases the likelihood of more pandemics, flooding, droughts and the destabilisation of economies.

Meanwhile attention has also been focussed on the generational response to the crisis. Those reaching adulthood in the early 21st century – Millennials and Generation Z – were initially accused of having too carefree an attitude to the virus, even being blamed for helping to spread infection. But it is becoming clear that the response of young people is leading to intergenerational innovation to find ways to survive and grow.

Millennials and Generation Z make up nearly 40 percent of workers in fragile areas such as childcare, restaurants, and tourism – and are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of measures designed to tackle Covid-19. But these young people are also collaborative, comfortable with electronic communication and the use of technology, and above all, adaptable.

They are the generations most likely to seek out sustainable brands, say economists. Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is a pioneer of in this field. In 2018 their 28 Sustainable Living Brands grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business – up from 46 percent the previous year. Much of this growth, Unilever believes, is down to the attitudes of younger generations.

Elizabeth Uviebinené, the British author of Slay in You Lane: The Black Girl Bible, summed up this opinion, saying: “Despite the uncertainty ahead, I take comfort in the fact that millennials are a resilient and adaptable generation because we’ve always had to be, and this setback will be no different.”

The Business & Sustainable Development Commission, launched in Davos, Switzerland in 2016, believes that at least $12 trillion could be unlocked through the expansion of sustainable business over the next decade, creating up to 380 million new jobs by 2030.

Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, the Director of SDG Impact at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), says that the pandemic has exposed the world’s weaknesses, and “reminded us about how interconnected all our fortunes are”.

“We now have the opportunity to create a better, stronger, more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for all,” she says. “Rather than assume that the pandemic makes our task harder, we should capitalise on the opportunity and space it provides to challenge conventional wisdom.”

In 2018, KPMG reported that of the world’s 250 largest companies, only 101 mentioned SDGs in their corporate reporting, and of these, just eight made the business case for SDGS.

Ms Davidsen says: “Too often the SDGs are used as just another reporting lens to communicate existing activities differently, rather than to make different decisions. While interest in the SDGs has been building, business leaders tell us they still do not have all the tools and information they need.”

Her role, as the pandemic recedes, is to build a common business framework to guide companies, creating a greater sense of confidence in an uncertain time, she said.

António Guterres believes that people have finally become conscious of the seriousness of the virus and its effects, and now understand that global solidarity and co-ordination of action was required not only to defeat coronavirus, but also to keep the wheels of the world economy turning.

Despite the apparent chaos in the global response to coronavirus, the conflicting advice of experts, the attempts to pin blame, the rhetoric of leaders like Mr Trump, the failure to follow WHO guidance by some, the opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties by others, Mr Guterres remains optimistic that the world can recover, and a new, equitable future be created.

And it would seem that his cautious optimism is shared. Global Web Index, a London-based consumer research body, believes that optimism is a key factor in navigating the coronavirus crisis – and its extensive market research appears to bear that out.

An internet survey of 14,000 people across 13 countries conducted during the height of the pandemic in March 2020 found a reassuringly high level of optimism for recovery among respondents, though there were significant variations between countries.

China saw the highest levels of optimism at 93 percent, while in Japan only 17 percent were hopeful of a positive outcome. In the USA and UK, there was an approximate 50:50 split between confidence and pessimism. According to Global Web Index, good communication appears to be the key to maintaining consumer optimism, with those who felt well-informed being generally less concerned for the future.

The Great Plague of 1665 was the first time the citizens of England had suffered such pestilence since the dreadful years of the Black Death in the 14th century. It took them by surprise in much the same way as coronavirus shocked a modern world where such events were seen as things of the past. The Black Death wiped out almost 45 per cent of England’s population in the mid-1300s, and in doing so, also obliterated the feudal system, laying the foundation for a modern nation. Similarly, the Great Plague, followed the next year by the Great Fire of London, allowed the city to transform into a progressive capital. From calamity can come hope.

In his journal of the plague year, Daniel Defoe echoes this conviction with a grimly comic observation that there may yet be cause for hopefulness:

“This is a world of corpses strewn in the streets and pits, yet in the deadcart itself a drunken piper wakes up to cry, ‘But I an’t dead tho’ am I?’”

The asset manager has unveiled the Allianz Positive Change, Allianz Clean Planet and Allianz Food Security funds, which will be jointly managed by its thematic team under Citywire A-rated Andreas Fruschki (pictured).

The team currently includes portfolio managers David Finger, Kofi Tweneboa-Kodua, Robbie Miles and Shibo Wang, as well as product specialist Alexandra Russo.

The new equity funds will closely follow eight larger themes: social inclusion, health, financial inclusion, education, food security, water, clean land/circular economy and energy transition.

The team will select companies that offer solutions to issues addressed by one or more of the SDGs. This in turn will allow the team to tap into specific themes and topics, for example education technology within the education theme or sustainable agriculture within food security.

The Allianz Positive Change fund, for example, will invest a minimum of 90% of its assets in the shares of international companies providing solutions to achieve the UN SDGs.

Meanwhile, the Allianz Clean Planet fund targets companies offering products or solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges related to three dimensions of a clean environment: clean air, clean land, clean water.

The third new strategy, the Allianz Food Security fund, allocates to companies offering products or solutions that actively contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes along the entire food supply chain across production, transportation, quality and safety of food.

For all three strategies up to 50% of their assets may be invested in the emerging markets. The SDG-aligned strategies also take an active approach to ESG integration, including a detailed assessment of the most significant risk factors, and exclusion criteria.

The three new strategies will sit alongsid the group’s existing thematic funds, which include the Allianz Global Water and Allianz Smart Energy funds.

Commenting on the launches, Fruschki said: ‘While each company that we consider eligible for an SDG strategy has a clear role to play in achieving the relevant SDG, the exact extent of its contribution to the UN goal can be difficult to quantify. That makes a thorough, qualitative research process essential.’

‘Given the global focus on the UN goals, companies that directly support them are likely to benefit from increased interest and growth. This may represent a strong investment case generating sustainable returns,’ he added.

The 17 sustainable development goals of the UN have 169 underlying targets, addressing global challenges related to society and the environment. According to UN, $2.5trn of capital is needed annually to finance the achievement of the goals.","Allianz Global Investors has launched three thematic strategies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Citywire Selector has learned.

“By mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest, the SDG Investor Map lays out pathways that can bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for six SDG-enabling sectors....,” according to an official release circulated by the Commerce & Industry Ministry on Thursday.

A rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks was carried out to identify the focus sectors and the IOAs within them, the release said. This was to ensure that the map’s findings reflected the market sentiment.

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are mature investable areas that have seen robust private equity and venture capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability, the release added.

The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors.

‘White spaces’

The map has also identified eight ‘white spaces’, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs in five to six years with policy support and private sector participation.","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Invest India, the national investment promotion agency under the Commerce & Industry Ministry, have launched the ‘SDG (sustainable development goals) Investor Map’ for India with 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical sectors such as education and healthcare to help the country achieve its development goals.

The 20 October meeting of the Negotiating Group on Rules heard a proposal from Brazil on percentage cuts to subsidies, and discussed the issue of proportionality in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing violations.

Ambassador Santiago Wills (Colombia) introduced a draft consolidated text on 25 June, with the aim of concluding negotiations by the end of 2020, in line with SDG target 14.6. Throughout October, the Negotiating Group of Rules held several rounds of meetings to review the text and propose amendments. During a meeting from 7-8 October, the Group discussed whether and how to define what counts as “fish,” whether to allow subsidies in the aftermath of natural disasters or similar events, how to address maritime disputes, and the issue of territoriality.

On 9 October, heads of delegations met and said a revised version of the draft consolidated text would be helpful. Some members supported continued small group discussions to draft compromise language before presenting it to the wider group, while others expressed concern about not being included in smaller meetings. Members expressed different perspectives on the pace of the negotiations, with some calling for more frequent meetings to conclude negotiations by the end of 2020 and others emphasizing challenges with the current pace and level of coordination needed. One member said the current placeholder for text on requiring members to be transparent about their subsidy programmes should now be expanded.

On 20 October, Brazil introduced a revised proposal to reduce and limit WTO members’ fisheries subsidies, which provides for adjustments to a table of percentage cuts that a member should make based on the size of its fisheries subsidies. The proposal would increase the amount of a subsidy programme shielded from cuts from USD 15 million to 25 million. Members falling under the smallest subsidy bracket, who can also demonstrate small catch volumes and short fishing distances, would have the possibility to add an additional USD 5 million, increasing their total cap to USD 30 million. Brazil said the proposal responds to suggestions and questions from members, and will provide a simple way for members to achieve an ambitious outcome.

Brazil also proposed an expanded negotiation timeline with three stages. The first stage would consist of an agreement on modalities (the percentage cuts and implementation process), and the second would consist of members providing negotiations with their baseline subsidy figure to which reductions would be applied. Brazil’s proposal states that big subsidizers who delay their notification would receive a penalty at this second stage. In a third stage, members with larger subsidy programmes would be expected to respond and adjust their figures if questioned. A final compliance and review would follow these stages.

On proportionality in IUU fishing violations, the Group discussed what criteria for due process, if any, a determination of IUU fishing should meet to trigger a subsidy prohibition and whether subsidy prohibitions should be waived when an IUU fishing infraction is minor.

The Group planned to continue discussing these issues on 21 and 23 October. Clusters of meetings will be held from 2-6 November and from 30 November to 4 December.

The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said.

It is thus critical to ensure that these pathways are sustainable, resilient and equitable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SDG financing gap has widened by an estimated USD 400 billion in developing countries, adding to the pre-COVID shortfall of USD 2-2.5 trillion per annum, it said.

Whilst the government continues to show strong support for the SDGs and a sustainable recovery, mobilizing this kind of capital and supporting the on-ground innovation needed to meet the SDG targets by 2030, requires the collective efforts of the public and private sector transition from short-term recovery to long-term sustainability, said the release.

The 6 SDG-enabling sectors include education, healthcare, agriculture & allied activities, financial services, renewable energy & alternatives and sustainable environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

This ensured that the Map''s findings were truly reflective of market sentiment, the UNDP said.

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust private equity and venture capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability.

The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors, said the UN development agency.

The UNDP said nearly 50 per cent of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs (internal rate of return) in excess of 20 per cent. While 84 per cent of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Invest India on Friday launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 investment opportunities areas (IOAs).
These IOAs are in six critical SDG (sustainable development goals) enabling sectors that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development, the UNDP, which works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities through the sustainable development of nations, said in a release.
This initiative is an instrumental stride in India''s development trajectory, and I believe it couldn''t have come at a better time.

It’s only morning.”

An OPP cruiser, lights flashing, was parked in front of the Ingleside Foodland. There, a few volunteers and two auxiliary sergeants were on hand to collect monetary donations as well as food donations — and they were quite busy.

It was a different story for the SDG Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Stuff the Cruiser event however. Held on Saturday at various locations — Alexandria, Winchester, Ingleside, Chesterville and Morrisburg from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., the fundraiser that aims at filling local food bank shelves was a hit.

INGLESIDE — The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected local food banks — more residents are now using their services, while fundraisers struggle to collect enough funds to keep up with the rising demand.

In order to help the fundraiser, Foodland offered shoppers the chance to purchase bags of already assembled, non-perishable foods. These were made up of food staples — beans, pasta, pasta sauce and cans of soups.

Nearly every shopper that left the store had one in their cart, which they gently placed inside of giant barrels resembling cans of soup.

Yet it wasn’t just food donations that were handed out — so was money and lots of it.

“Usually, we have people handing us five dollars or something like that,” said Chris Quenville, another Agape Centre volunteer. “But today, we had people giving us forty dollars and even fifty dollars. It’s incredible. We even had someone give us 60 dollars. We’ve never seen this.”

Both Auxiliary Sgt. Doug Behn and Auxiliary Sgt. Lambia Kavitsiotis were also impressed with the amount of donations that were flowing out of the store during the fundraiser.

“The feedback we’ve been getting is very positive,” said Kavitsiotis. “People are really being generous today, it’s great.”

“This is their biggest food fundraiser and the barrels they brought are already nearly full,” added Behn.

The Agape Centre, like many other local food banks, has seen its customer base increase during the COVID pandemic.

“We serve 90 to 100 a day for hot lunches, three days a week,” said Quenville. “Some of them are also people we don’t recognize, people that have never had to come to us before.”

According to him, some of the Agape’s clientele is now made up of individuals having come from as far as Toronto or Ottawa.

“When the pandemic happened, they left the big hubs for smaller places,” he said. “It’s been very busy at the Agape.”

Although the exact number of donations had yet to be tallied, last year’s event resulted in a total of $3,700 in monetary donations and 4,400 pounds of food.

217,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/pacific-islands-report-on-sdg-efforts-for-blue-pacific/,"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Pacific Islands Report on SDG Efforts for Blue Pacific,"At the two-year mark of the Pacific region’s sustainable development plan, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat has released an update report measuring progress on the SDGs. It focuses on nine action areas contained in the 2018 Quadrennial Pacific Sustainable Development Report that aim to contextualize the SDGs to Pacific realities.

The nine action areas, which align with a commitment by the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, are:

Addressing vulnerability and increasing inequality; Tackling gender gaps and high youth unemployment; Continuing to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth; Intensifying multi-sector efforts with increased finance to address non-communicable diseases; Strengthening efforts to tackle the dual threats of climate change and disasters; Addressing the consequences of population growth and poor waste management practices; Continuing to address de-risking issues and the high cost of sending remittances; More effective use of existing and new finance and stronger coordination; and Increasing investment in the collection and use of timely and accurate disaggregated data.

The report makes recommendations for the nine action areas. To address vulnerability and reduce inequality, it recommends that countries strengthen existing social protection and economic empowerment measures, develop education policies and programs to promote disability inclusive education, and mainstream an inclusive approach to ensure all development, including COVID-19 response and recovery, delivers shared benefits that include vulnerable groups.

To promote sustainable, equitable economic growth, the authors recommend that countries address the lack of data, methodologies and limited statistical capacity in the region to monitor SDG progress, adopt the Action Plan for the Regional Longline Fisheries Strategy, with indicators to measure progress, and support the work of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to improve labor conditions and address modern slavery conditions in the fisheries sector.

To build resilience and tackle climate change and natural disasters, countries are urged to ensure that local, national, and regional climate change adaptation planning process are effective and informed by up-to-date information.

The report also examines the Pacific region’s processes on the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), by which several countries decide to report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The report points to opportunities for strengthening capacity to involve stakeholders at national and sub-national levels, ways to strengthen linkages between budgets and plans, and ways to build and sustain data to better inform policy, planning, and budgets.

Nine member countries of the Pacific Island Forum had produced VNRs by 2019 and four more countries reported in 2020. The 2019 VNRs identified a number of challenges facing the national governments that reported: human and institutional capacity constraints; lack of political will and ownership to respond to the cross-sectoral nature of sustainable development; lack of alignment at national level with global and regional commitments, including the importance of localizing global goals, targets and indicators, lack of stakeholder engagement with government agencies, civil society and the private sector; limited capacity to collect and analyze data; and insufficient financial resources and capacity for resource mobilization.

On gender equality, the PIF report reaffirms the need to increase the participation of women in Pacific economies, and the need to reduce the high rate of violence against women and girls. The report also reviews progress under the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration (PLEGD) and analyzes country progress reports for the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 25-year review. The report recommends advocating for decent work opportunities for all and continuing to address the root causes of gender inequality.

On the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, the report states that it has caused “unprecedented disruption” and is “likely to undo gains previously reported in 2018” as well as in the last two years. The report observes that COVID-19 has affected the region’s good progress towards sustainability in the fisheries sector, efforts to address the high costs of remittances, and progress to improve returns and increase community involvement in tourism.

At the report’s launch, PIF Secretary-General Meg Taylor said the report “confirms the slow progress on our development targets in the Pacific.” Despite some significant achievements, she said the report highlights increasing vulnerabilities, deepening inequalities, and limited access to infrastructure and basic services, including inconsistent access to affordable and quality health care, and a need to improve access to quality education. She called for the region to work together to accelerate progress on SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).

Taylor also highlighted the Forum’s ongoing work to develop the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, and she said that at least 90% of its member countries are expected to have completed their first or undertaken their second VNR by 2022.

218,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-index-finds-no-european-country-on-track-green-deal-brings-potential/,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Index Finds No European Country on Track, Green Deal Brings Potential","The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) launched the 2020 edition of the Europe Sustainable Development Report (ESDR). The ESDR 2020 provides an updated SDG Index and Dashboards for European countries, reports on spillover effects on other countries, and makes recommendations for strengthening SDG implementation and the European Green Deal.

The ESDR 2020 is the second report on the SDG progress of the EU, its member states, and other European countries. The report is part of a broader series of Sustainable Development Reports tracking the performances of countries and municipalities around the world on the SDGs. The 2020 ESDR examines six policy levers and tools for implementing SDG transformations in the EU:

A New European Industrial and Innovation Strategy for the SDGs; An investment plan and financing strategy aligned with the SDGs; Coherent national and EU SDG policies; Coordinated Green Deal and SDG Diplomacy; Regulations on business standards and reporting; and SDG monitoring and reporting framework.

The report finds that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, “no European country was on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.” The region faces the greatest challenges on sustainable agriculture and diets (SDG 2), climate (SDG 13), biodiversity (15), and in addressing inequalities in living standards across its countries and regions (SDGs 1 and 10). The authors report that unsustainable diets, high and rising obesity rates, and unsustainable agriculture and farming practices are contributing to the EU and partner countries “performing especially poorly” on SDG 2.

The Nordic countries again performed the best on the SDG Index. Finland placed the highest, with a score of 81.10. Other countries in the top five are: Sweden (81.02), Denmark (80.05), Austria (77.35), and Norway (77.03). Even these countries face challenges on several SDGs. Finland, for instance, received red scores (classified as “major challenges remain”) on SDG 2, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13. Sweden scored red on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15.

The report features a leave no one behind score that tracks four dimensions of inequality: poverty, services, gender, and income. Countries with a higher score have fewer population groups that are being left behind. Norway (87.03), Finland (86.69), and Iceland (84.23) placed the highest. Greece (57.82), Bulgaria (47.97), and Romania (47.74) ranked the lowest.

On COVID-19, the report observes that suppressing the virus remains an urgent priority for the EU. The EU has recorded more cases and deaths from COVID-19 than the Asia-Pacific region. The authors underscore the need to strengthen the EU’s preparedness, coordination, and resilience for pandemics in order to achieve SDG target 3.d on preparedness for global health security issues, and to prepare for climate-related and other risks. The report further recommends using the SDGs as a framework to build back better and investing in green infrastructure, digitization, and responsible consumption and production, combined with efforts and investments to boost education and skills throughout Europe and coordinated efforts to reform tax systems, particularly digital taxes.

The report highlights the potential of the Next Generation EU-COVID-19 recovery package and the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2021-2027) to put Europe on a path towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery. SDSN Executive Director Guido Schmidt-Traub called on the EU to “provide global leadership on the goals.” He said the EU has the tools in place to achieve the SDGs internally, but they “must be more clearly organized around the six transformations.” In addition the EU must be prepared to “promote SDG and Green Deal diplomacy ahead of the climate and biodiversity COPs in 2021.”

The report includes the 2020 International Spillover report, which shows how unsustainable supply chains and trade-related spillovers from the EU have “serious environmental, social and economic consequences for the rest of the world.” For example, unsustainable supply chains lead to deforestation and increased biodiversity threats, hindering global progress on SDGs 13 and 15. EU imports of clothing, textile, and leather products are linked with 37 fatal workplace accidents and 21,000 non-fatal accidents per year. The report recommends that the EU address negative international spillovers by reducing trade in waste, enacting coherent trade and external policies, strengthening tax cooperation and transparency, and applying EU standards to exports.

The German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, and the European Network of Political Foundations provided support for the report. SDSN and IEEP produced the report in collaboration with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), SDSN Germany, and national and regional SDSN networks in Europe.

For the UN’s 75th, a concerted effort focused on asking a million members of the public for help in steering its next 25 years. Governments also spent several months, during a pandemic, negotiating a political declaration with 12 commitments for re-energizing multilateralism, and they have issued a request for a set of recommendations from the UN Secretary-General on ensuring the UN rises to the challenges of current and future generations.

The timeframe set for the UN’s self-reflection – looking to the world in 2045 – is longer than the usual timeframes of international road maps and agreements. We have International Days (so many that some days of the year contain more than one “Day” within them). We have International Years; 2020 is the international year of the nurse and midwife (thank you, nurses and midwives) and the international year of plant health (thank you plants, too). We are also accustomed to titling ten-year periods by broad goals that need worldwide attention and effort. We are in the midst of international decades on biodiversity, people of African descent, sustainable energy, nutrition, poverty eradication, water, peace, and several more.

Setting plans for longer than a decade is a display of ambition but also reflects the scale of the problem. The eight Millennium Development Goals had a 15-year timeframe (2000-2015). The 17 global goals devised to succeed and broaden the MDGs also look 15 years ahead, to what will hopefully be a more sustainable world.

But it is a singular initiative that looks 25 years into the future and sketches its contours by the dreams of the children and youth who will fill and govern that world, and decide how it is left for their own grandchildren. The UN75 process has not shied away from the scale of the problem. This policy brief reviews the milestones since early 2019, who said what along the way, and what might come next.

Timeline of UN75 Actions and Milestones

February 2019: Governments begin negotiating the details of the anniversary commemoration through consultations led by the permanent representatives of Iceland and Singapore.

April 2019: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appoints Fabrizio Hochschild as Special Adviser on Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary.

June 2019: Governments reach agreement (A/RES/73/299) on the theme of the anniversary meeting, date, format, and outcome, and note the importance of engaging civil society and youth in all commemoration activities. They decide to convene a youth plenary as part of the occasion. In this guest article for the SDG Knowledge Hub, Fergus Watt explains the points of contention regarding modalities.

October 2019: The UN announces a public consultation process to help determine how the UN should improve and assess “the future people want, and the UN we need.” Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild says that instead, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”

January 2020: The UN launches the “global conversation” with a one-minute survey. Over the next eight months the outreach process will comprise 1,000 dialogues in 80 countries, with over one million people in all 193 Member States of the UN, scientifically sampled surveys in 50 countries conducted by two independent companies, the first-ever AI analysis of social and traditional media, and university and think-tank research.

February 2020: The permanent representatives of Qatar and Sweden serve as co-facilitators for the political declaration and begin consultations. One speaker at an early meeting says the UN “has enough documents” and it is time to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlight the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.” Initial discussions also note the importance of engaging women, girls, and all youth. But one says that “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She calls for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

March 2020: The UN75 youth plenary is postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will eventually be rescheduled for early September 2020 and take place virtually. Intergovernmental consultations on the political declaration also shift to virtual formats.

May 2020: Civil society networks hold the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need via virtual formats. Participants adopt a plan for action and priority recommendations for the UN and Member States, including to establish a Member-State-mandated, post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance. Signatories see such a mechanism as ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions.

July 2020: Consensus is reached on a political declaration to be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the 75th commemoration. The 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is less fortunate: the ministerial declaration that was under negotiation for several months through remote means could not be finalized. But statements made during the meeting send a clear message that multilateralism is a priority for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stress that the only way out of the pandemic-induced crisis is through global solidarity.

Among the actions proposed for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, as reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, are:

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

using broader measures of vulnerability;

reform of international financial institutions;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

9 September 2020: The UN holds a UN75 Youth Plenary. One speaker says “people my age are unafraid to make change happen even when the world gives them little opportunity to do so.” Hochschild offers a preview of results from the global conversation, noting that 90% of young people surveyed – more than any other age group – believe global cooperation is vital. He observes, “this does not surprise me at all: young people are deeply multilateral.”

16 September 2020: The UN Economists Network launches a report with advice on steering five current megatrends toward positive outcomes. The authors stress that achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking,” but if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time” in a sustainable, equitable direction.

18 September 2020: A letter signed by 49 leaders calls on governments to undertake institutional retooling of the UN. In a press release, signatory Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, points to “hard months and years ahead,” and says multilateralism represents the “only path that can deliver a green, sustainable and equitable recovery” from the pandemic.

21 September 2020: The UN75 office releases interim findings of the global conversation. The Special Adviser reports that they reveal “remarkable unity among respondents of all ages, regions, and social groups.” This guest article by Fabrizio Hochschild underlines that regarding the world in 25 years, respondents’ overwhelming concern relates to the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment, and this is the top concern even amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents also find international cooperation to be even more urgent due to the pandemic, and believe that more lives would be saved with better cooperation. Finally, people are looking for a UN that better reflects the stakeholders of the 21st century, that innovates more, and that is more diverse, more transparent, more accountable, and more effective.

21 September: The UN General Assembly holds a high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary. World leaders adopt the declaration agreed in July (UN/75/1), which recognizes multilateralism as necessary for a more equal, resilient, and sustainable world, and implementation of the 2030 Agenda as necessary for survival.

October 2020: Meetings following the anniversary event intensify the focus on local-led action (ICLEI/Daring Cities Forum and UCLG gathering of mayors), with UCLG Secretary General Emilia Saiz emphasizing in a guest article, “Local and regional governments are saying it loud and clear. We need to change the game and we are the game changers.” Other events around the world amplify the message that youth are central to a multilateralism that works.

Beginning the Next 25 Years

Writing before the anniversary meeting, the SDG Knowledge Hub editors observed that after a year full of discussions on multilateralism, the international community should be prepared to shape their ideas into “a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.” If, as governments said during the HLPF in July 2020, the only way out of today’s crisis is through global solidarity, then the international community must make time for action along the lines highlighted at meetings over the past year. If multilateralism is to “survive the pandemic,” on top of all of the other challenges it faces, governments and other actors must find ways to use it in humanity’s time of greatest need. This begins with showing solidarity with others. Cooperating to provide COVID-19 vaccines is a key place to start.

On 15 December 2020, UN Member States will gather in the UNGA Hall to begin discussing the follow-up to the UN75 declaration. They will hear Secretary-General Guterres’ vision for reinvigorating multilateralism and revitalizing the UN. He is also expected to provide a glimpse of the process by which he will develop recommendations, responding to governments’ request in the September declaration.

The public consultation continues until the end of 2020. The final UN75 report will be published in early 2021, and will inform the UN Secretary-General’s response to the political declaration.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has said the interests of individual Member States have repeatedly prevented the international order from functioning as it was intended, forcing the UN to “lag behind its ideals.” This is a moment in history when saving oneself begins with helping others – but this will not be the last such moment. As the end of 2020 is finally near, governments that can afford to do so should prepare to help others in more and deeper ways than they have done before in order to save multilateralism and themselves.

By Faye Leone, IISD","The timeframe set for the UN’s self-reflection – looking to the world in 2045 – is longer than the usual timeframes of international road maps and agreements.
The 17 global goals devised to succeed and broaden the MDGs also look 15 years ahead, to what will hopefully be a more sustainable world.
This policy brief reviews the milestones since early 2019, who said what along the way, and what might come next.

The toolbox identifies available IOMC resources to help countries, focusing on simple, cost-effective solutions to national chemicals management issues.

The management schemes relate to:

Chemical accident prevention, preparedness and response to help protect the health of workers and the public;

A classification and labelling system;

Industrial chemicals management to strengthen national capacity in assessing risks associated with industrial chemicals;

National management of Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs), publicly accessible databases or inventories of chemicals or pollutants released to air, water, and soil and transferred off-site for treatment;

National management of pesticides, covering the pesticide lifecycle from production to registration, distribution, use, and disposal;

Occupational health and safety management for chemicals;

Public health chemicals management; and

Best available techniques, which help establish emission limit values and other permit conditions for industrial emissions.

The six external toolkits developed by IOMC organizations are the:

Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Pesticide Registration Toolkit;

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Environmental Risk Assessment Toolkit;

UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Chemical Leasing Toolkit;

UNIDO Innovative Approaches for the Sound Management of Chemicals and Chemical Waste Toolkit;

UNIDO Green Chemistry Toolkit; and

World Health Organization (WHO) Human Health Risk Assessment Toolkit: Chemical Hazards.

IOMC notes that the Toolbox is a work in progress, with additional updates expected to expand its scope in the future.

A new schedule for meetings in 2021 is being developed, with the aim of bringing “this negotiation to the finish line.”

The WTO’s 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) and SDG target 14.6 give negotiators the task of securing an agreement on eliminating subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and to prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing by the end of 2020. In March 2020, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the suspension of in-person meetings, and members used online meetings and written exchanges to continue negotiations. Despite their efforts and “almost daily” meetings in late November, WTO members were unable to finish negotiations at the 14 December informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee.

Throughout 2020, members have negotiated on the basis of a draft consolidated text first introduced in June 2020 and then on a revised version introduced in early November 2020. The draft text addresses all the main pillars of the negotiations, including prohibitions on subsidies, a placeholder for a capping mechanism and a list of non-harmful subsidies, provisions for special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries (LDCs), technical assistance and capacity building, notification and transparency, institutional arrangements, and dispute settlement. During the final “cluster” of discussions in the 2020 work programme, heads of delegations provided drafting suggestions on IUU fishing, overcapacity and overfishing, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.

On overfishing and overcapacity, a provision in the draft text allows members to maintain or grant certain capacity-building subsidies if a member can demonstrate that fishery management measures are being implemented to maintain a sustainable level of fish stocks. Brazil and the US urged elaborating on a capping mechanism in the text to complement overcapacity prohibitions that are currently in the draft.

On special and differential treatment, members reiterated varying positions during a 2 December meeting. India had proposed draft text to exempt from subsidy bans developing countries that meet certain fishing volume and gross national income (GNI) thresholds. Several members observed a lack of convergence around this text although members also signaled openness to explore and refine the proposed criteria-based approach.

The chair of the negotiations, Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, said “while I am disappointed that we will miss the 2020 deadline, I am not discouraged.” He stressed “real progress” was made on the negotiations during 2020, despite difficulties caused by COVID-19-related disruptions, and emphasized that WTO members are committed to build on their progress and reach a conclusion.

WTO Deputy Director-General Karl Brauner recognized WTO members’ “intensive work on fisheries subsidies” at the Trade Negotiations Committee and Heads of Delegation meeting on 14 December. He agreed with Ambassador Wills’ assessment and observed that the negotiations have made “considerable concrete progress towards finding a solution that all Members can accept.” Brauner said greater political will, pressure from civil society, and renewed engagement will help members finalize an agreement. He called for “compromise by everyone, on all issues” and accelerated activity in 2021 that continues “until we deliver” an agreement.

In their updated NDCs, Switzerland and Costa Rica commit to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform (Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay) and the UK issued a joint statement, encouraging countries and stakeholders to continue reform and ensure the COVID-19 economic recovery is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

UK Submits First NDC

The UK’s NDC, submitted on 12 December, represents an increase from its previous contribution to the EU’s intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to amount to a 53% reduction on reference levels. According to the UK’s independent statutory body, Climate Change Committee, the country’s new target aligns with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways towards a 1.5°C goal.

By raising ambition, the UK signals its leadership role as co-host of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in 2021. In 2021, the UK will also preside over the Group of Seven (G7), and COP 26 co-host Italy will hold the Group of 20 (G20) presidency.

The UK intends to meet its NDC mitigation targets through reducing emissions domestically, and reserves the right to use voluntary cooperation, such as through the use of emissions trading systems and emissions reduction or removal units. The UK’s NDC encompasses emissions and removals from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The scope of the NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and shipping. The communication covers the following sectors: energy (including transport); industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and waste.

The NDC informs of institutional structures and updates on policy measures, including an amendment to the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2019, committing the UK to a legally-binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Act also introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, and established the Climate Change Committee to provide advice.

The NDC highlights the UK’s progress on climate action policy areas linked to the SDGs, including:

In the area of food security and policy, the UK is phasing down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including in refrigeration equipment for food storage and distribution, in line with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

Addressing ocean and marine environment, the UK will introduce a sustainable fisheries policy, giving consideration to climate change in marine planning, building ecological resilience at sea, and protecting natural carbon stores through the UK’s network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Regarding terrestrial biodiversity in England, the government will publish a new strategy for nature following agreement of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), expected in 2021.

To promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, the UK supports a sustainable food system, and has a resources and waste strategy to move towards a more circular and sustainable economy.

The UK’s Clean Air Strategy aims to tackle air pollution, noted as the top environmental risk to human health in the UK.

The UK describes its adaptation actions in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Switzerland Submits Updated and Enhanced NDC

Switzerland’s updated NDC, communicated on 9 December, states its enhanced ambition is in line with IPCC recommendations to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 40-50% compared with 2010 levels by 2030, to limit global warming to 1.5°C . The country commits to climate neutrality by 2050, which is an increase on its previous objective of a 70-85% emissions reduction by 2050.

The NDC describes Switzerland’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which corresponds to an average reduction of at least 3% over the period 2021-2030. Switzerland anticipates to reach GHG emissions reductions of at least 35% by 2025. The NDC also represents a “progression” in terms of, inter alia: a 25% increase of the domestic share of emissions reduction, from 60% to at least 75%; and compensation of imported “grey” emissions through additional emission reductions abroad, not counted towards Switzerland’s emissions reduction objectives.

The NDC anticipates Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) from cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 “will partly be used.” It informs of Switzerland’s bilateral agreements with Peru and Ghana that govern the transfers of mitigation outcomes and their use, and define the method for corresponding adjustment.

The NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and navigation, although Switzerland’s domestic emissions reduction targets incorporate emissions from national aviation and navigation. According to the NDC, a part of emissions from international aviation is covered by the Swiss emission trading scheme (ETS) as well as by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

In the energy sector, the NDC notes Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050, with the objective to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. The country, it states, needs to replace the share of its nuclear energy, given the government’s decision to gradually phase out nuclear energy. The NDC also notes that, according to Switzerland’s seventh national communication to the UNFCCC, around three-quarters of Switzerland’s GHG emissions result from fossil fuel use.

The NDC informs of a 2019 popular initiative, calling for a constitutional article to stipulate a ban of fossil fuels as of 2050. Switzerland emphasizes it is actively reviewing its remaining fossil fuel subsidies, and is engaged in Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (FFFSR) – an informal group of non-G20 countries working to build political consensus on the importance of fossil fuel subsidy reform.

Besides energy (including transport), Switzerland’s mitigation commitments cover industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste. Switzerland’s adaptation actions are described in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Costa Rica Communicates NDC Update

In its NDC update of 11 December (in Spanish), Costa Rica announces it is enhancing its climate ambition and will submit a more specific communication by the end of 2020. The update highlights Costa Rica’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and commitment to a maximum budget of net emissions in the 2021-2030 period of 106.53 million tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).

The submission briefly updates on Costa Rica’s legal and institutional framework for climate action, including the country’s 2018 National Adaptation Policy, and the 2019 National Decarbonization Plan presented as a long-term strategy. Costa Rica informs of an enhanced mitigation commitment to an absolute maximum of net emissions by 2030 of 9.11 million tons CO2e, an improvement on the previous maximum of 9.37 million tons CO2e. This target, according to the submission, is consistent with the country’s long-term strategy and the trajectory towards the 1.5°C goal.

Highlighting the need to close social gaps and strengthen economic and environmental resilience in the country, Costa Rica notes its adaptation actions will be outlined in its forthcoming Adaptation Communication.

UK, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Issue Joint Statement

On 10 December, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform and the UK issued a joint statement, stressing the importance of a green recovery from COVID-19, without which “there is a risk that fiscal stimulus packages will further entrench the use of fossil fuels.” The statement recalls the principles outlined in the group’s 2015 communiqué, and welcomes renewed political commitments to reform made since 2015 by the G7, the G20, the Vulnerable Twenty (V20), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders, among others.

The statement recalls the principles that shall inform practical action:

Communication and transparency about the merits of subsidy policies;

Ambition in the scope and timeframe for reform; and

Only countries and stakeholders making new and ambitious announcements were given a speaking slot during the virtual event. The 111 speakers included Heads of State and Government as well as non-governmental actors representing youth, subnational governments, business, Indigenous peoples, and civil society.

The golden thread of climate action should weave through every international gathering in 2021. COP 26 President-designate Sharma

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report of the event, which took place on 12 December 2020, indicates that statements coalesced around four themes: new and enhanced Paris Agreement medium-term plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs); long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, as requested by the Paris Agreement, and mid-century, net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and GHG emissions targets; adaptation plans and strategies; and climate finance.

Seventy-five leaders announced new commitments, some of which had been communicated in recent months or days, or indicated ongoing work. Among the major announcements were China’s NDC-related commitment to lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% by 2030, from 2005 levels; the European Union’s NDC-related pledge to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030; and the UK’s NDC-related target of reducing GHG emissions at least 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Additional pledges included:

Net zero-related pledges by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden;

by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden; Adaptation pledges by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and

by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and Climate finance pledges including from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, and the UK.

The Cities Race to Zero – part of the global Race to Zero Campaign – was joined by 72 new cities and local authorities from Belgium, China, Denmark, and the UK. And companies from the manufacturing, industry, aviation, transport, technology, and fashion industries offered mitigation pledges.

In his closing remarks, COP 26 President-designate Alok Sharma, UK, announced that the UK will double its climate finance contribution to USD 15.5 billion over the next five years.

In all, Sharma said 45 NDCs, 24 net zero commitments, and 20 adaptation and resilience plans were announced during the event. He called for “the golden thread of climate action to weave through every international gathering” in 2021.

Article content Special Lessons in ACNH at Koto-ku 6th Sunamachi Elementary School, Grade 5 The special open class saw participation from 30 children at Tokyo’s 6th Sunamachi Elementary School. The Floating City within ACNH is home to numerous animals, including some endangered species, and the virtual island also incorporates various activities for fun, guided learning. Children actively asked questions in the session, which focused on current global environmental issues and was led by fisheries scientist Dr. Hiroaki Chiba, an associate professor at Kitasato University. After the lesson, Dr. Chiba commented, “Learning about the environment through games is a great educational tool which creates an opportunity to think about environmental issues and the future.” The Floating City lets children experience environmental issues through ACNH In the special lesson, children experienced The Floating City within ACNH through gameplay, deepening their understanding of environmental issues while visiting the island’s various virtual facilities. They learned about sustainable living on The Floating City, which echoes a real floating island, with a wind farm to create electricity through the power of nature and a restaurant serving dishes prepared only from ingredients grown on the island. The game also provides enjoyable opportunities to experience environmental issues, such as visiting a museum of endangered animals and talking with an African elephant. Children were excited by the fishing and bug-catching activities, and enthralled by the island’s many unique features. Lesson topics: Global environmental issues and the future of fish Dr. Hiroaki Chiba joined as a special guest instructor and delivered a lesson on what can be done to resolve current environmental issues and marine pollution. Beginning with an explanation of the serious environmental impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels, he described how Japan’s abundant ocean ecosystem has been disrupted by global warming and the acidification of seawater caused by this greenhouse gas, as well as by overfishing. Dr. Chiba also raised the pressing issue of ocean plastic pollution, pointing out that the cumulative amount of plastic waste in the world is predicted to exceed 12 billion tons by 2050. These plastics are the source of countless “microplastic” particles that cannot be broken down by waves or ultraviolet rays, and even hold the potential to turn oceans into a plastic “soup” uninhabitable to fish. When asked by the children about fish populations around the world, Dr. Chiba explained that fish numbers are decreasing worldwide due to shrinking habitats for cold-water fish caused by global warming and rising sea temperatures.

Article content Finally, students studied the adverse impacts of environmental damage on humans. They learned what they can do to be more eco-friendly and help prevent marine pollution, including practicing the three R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle) and purchasing ecolabelled products. About The Floating City and Blue Frontiers Floating cities are a pioneering sustainability solution whose potential to combat various environmental issues has even seen them discussed by a UN-Habitat roundtable. The rich natural surroundings of this in-game recreation have numerous features designed to help users enjoy learning about sustainability and environmental issues––from the many animals representing endangered species who welcome visitors to the island, to fishing and bug-catching activities that generate a warning when users catch more than they need. The Floating City’s guided learning opportunities even include a museum dedicated to extinct animals and a restaurant with a menu that spotlights disappearing ingredients. The Floating City was created under the supervision of one co-founder of Blue Frontiers, a company that aims to build an environmentally friendly, sustainable floating island in the near future.

Counties Council supported the move at its December 21st meeting.

The move follows a contentious meeting in November when it appeared that not all areas of the county were working together on a rural education plan.

“I think the best way forward for us and develop an advocacy document that we can really use to promote rural education,” CAO Tim Simpson said adding that it wasn’t just for the region but at provincial conferences and with government officials. “I think this is the way to go.”

Simpson said the goal was to engage a consultant that had experience in education and knows how to navigate around the education system, school boards and get data to assist in creating a plan.

If approved, he said that he would be seeking input from councillors, staff, and public to create a terms of reference for the education consultant and then undergo the Request For Proposal process.

Once selected, a working group would be formed to work with the consultant on a plan with the hopes of completing it by Summer 2021.

Simpson did not say what the composition of a working group would look like or if there would be public input in creating the plan.

He said the timing to undergo this planning process was right.

“Everyone is consumed with COVID-19 right now so it is a good time to do this,” Simpson said. “Hopefully it will dove-tail nicely with getting a real professional document so we can go forward and say ‘look, you’ve told us rural education is important, here’s a way forward in our region that we think you should talk to us about.’”

Counties councillors were supportive of hiring a consultant.

“I think it will bring all the pieces together and it’s nice to have the non-political view on this,” said Councillor Kirsten Gardner (South Dundas). “Hopefully we will be able to get a consultant that not only knows about education but also funding formulas that the government uses. I think this is the way and hopefully we’ll find someone good.”

Councillor Jamie MacDonald (North Glengarry) said that he thought this was the best idea going forward and that having someone who is not politically involved will “bring everybody in together” on a plan.

Councillor Al Armstrong (North Dundas) said he would like to see a consultant who does not necessarily come just from an educator or school board background.

“With no disrespect to any of them, but that does sort of skirt the fine line of repetition in a different coat,” he said. “As we all spend a certain amount of time in certain vocations, you do become a bit familiar and forget the fact that we’re looking for a bit of innovation.”

He added that during the County’s strategic planning process, many councillors voiced their concerns about rural education in SDG Counties.

“We’ve all indicated we’re not really happy with the education system that we have,” Armstrong said. “One of our main priorities was to change the approach to how we get our youth prepared for life so the same-old, same-old is not going to work.

Councillors unanimously supported the action request and Counties CAO Tim Simpson said that the consultant would be a item for the draft 2021 budget.

The funding comes from the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF), a multi-stakeholder financial and capacity building platform, that bridges entrepreneurship, social innovation, and blended capital to create sustainable economic and social returns.

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative.
