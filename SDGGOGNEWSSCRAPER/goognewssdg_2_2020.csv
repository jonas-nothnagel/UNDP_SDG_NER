Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

His announcements included the co-facilitators he has appointed for several processes: preparations for the Biodiversity Summit, preparations for the Second Ocean Conference, preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary, and the intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

2,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/sdg-implementation-will-affect-forests-and-people/,"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: SDG Implementation Will Affect Forests and People,"Forests cover about one-third of the world’s land area and provide ecosystem services that are crucial to human well-being and for reaching the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. For example, forests are critical for climate change mitigation and for sustaining global biodiversity; they provide timber and non-timber forest products as well as pollination services that are critical for sustaining agricultural production. Forests can be directly or indirectly linked to each of the SDGs and the future of the world’s forests is critical for sustainable development at all scales, from global to local.

Little attention, however, has yet focused on how efforts towards achieving the SDGs will impact forests and forest-related livelihoods, and how these impacts may, in turn, enhance or undermine the contributions of forests to climate and development. Understanding the potential impacts of SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development as well as the related trade-offs and synergies is crucial for the efforts undertaken to reach these goals. It is especially important for reducing potential negative impacts and to leverage opportunities to create synergies that will ultimately determine whether comprehensive progress towards the SDGs will be made.

The book Sustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People by IUFRO WFSE (International Union of Forest Research Organizations’ special project World Forest, Society and Environment) provides a comprehensive assessment of potential and anticipated impacts of efforts towards attaining the different SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development. The development of this book involved 120 scientists and experts from 60 different universities and research and development organizations as well as 38 scientists who acted as peer reviewers of the 17 SDG chapters.

This book discusses the conditions that influence how SDGs are implemented and prioritized, and provides a systematic, multidisciplinary global assessment of interlinkages among the SDGs and their targets, increasing understanding of potential synergies and unavoidable trade-offs between goals from the point of view of forests and people.

The SDGs include partially conflicting visions for forests and people, making it necessary to consider trade-offs and to set priorities. National circumstances and development priorities influence how the SDGs are prioritized and how they are included in national strategies and policies. Measures taken to implement the SDGs vary according to economic prosperity, political stability, social cohesion, level of technological development and policy, institutional and social frameworks as well as geographic features and the natural resource base. The extent and condition of forest resources and the role of forests in industrial development and for livelihoods largely determine the relative importance given to forests in relation to other land uses. Social and cultural perspectives also play a key role, as do the values and interests of different actors in society, and their representation and voice pertaining to forest related decision making. These conditions greatly influence how synergies can be leveraged and unavoidable trade-offs mitigated.

There is large potential for synergies among the SDGs and their targets and the implementation of several SDGs can be beneficial for both forests and people. For example, SDG 13 (Climate action) should lead to more sustainable forest management and conservation as well as forest restoration. Improved resource efficiency, sustainable production and new technologies under SDG 12 (Sustainable production and consumption) and increased agricultural productivity for reaching food security (SDG 2) can also reduce pressures on forests. The interlinkage between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and forests relates to water availability and water quality. Generally forests have a positive impact on water quality. This favors maintaining forest cover and increasing cover in protected or degraded catchments. A focus on water efficiency, however, may restrict the establishment of new forest plantations in semi-arid areas.

For sustaining and enhancing forests’ contributions to achieving SDGs, it is also important to focus attention on participatory governance, the regulatory framework, the accountability and transparency of institutions, access to markets and finances, education and enhancing social capital. These issues have been found to contribute to an enabling environment for inclusive forest management and conservation with associated livelihood benefits. All these issues are also included in the SDGs and advancing towards them will support sustainable forest-related development and livelihoods.

On the other hand, efforts to advance towards some SDGs can affect land use directly and are thus expected to directly impact forests and pose serious threats to forests and the people living in or near them. For example, SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) may encourage infrastructure development and other activities which lead to forest loss. The expansion of agricultural crops for food or energy (SDG 2 Food security and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy) is also likely to compete with forests in many locations.

It is crucially important that the potential trade-offs implicit in the SDGs with respect to forests and other land uses are recognized, understood and made transparent to societies, and that the forest–people interconnectedness is fully accounted for in societal and policy decisions. This must include thinking across different scales and generations. When the implementation of SDGs and targets may have negative outcomes on forests and people alternative options that contribute to social development and forest conservation should be developed, or measures should be taken to reduce negative outcomes, for example by limiting infrastructure development to protect valuable biodiversity, other environmental values and indigenous people’s way of life.

In view of the diversity of forest-related societal needs, viewpoints, cultural values and interests different groups should have access to the SDG-related decision-making and implementation processes at all levels and these processes should be perceived by everyone as transparent, fair and effective. It is vitally important that all the relevant stakeholders, especially women, indigenous peoples and marginalized groups, are involved in the design and implementation of the SDGs.

Capturing the potential of forests and trees for sustainable development requires that they are integrated in efforts and measures undertaken to reach the SDGs and specific targets. In this process harnessing opportunities for beneficial synergies and mitigating trade-offs among the SDGs and their targets is of utmost importance. The implementation of the SDGs and associated goals and targets will also require continuous learning and adaptation of implementation strategies and approaches, but possibly also targets, taking into consideration observed outcomes.

Burden of malnutrition unacceptably high despite world being better equipped to fight it. Credit: Getty Images

India’s standing vis-a-vis United Nations-mandated goals has improved marginally, but the country has slipped in key areas, related to food security, livelihood and standard of living.

The country’s overall score of 60, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Index 2019-20 released by NITI Aayog, was three points above its 2018 standing. This was primarily due to better performance related to water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy as well as industry, innovation and infrastructure.

But the country was worse off in several goals (SDGs):

SDG 1 – Alleviating poverty

SDG 2 – Ending hunger

SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth

SDG 10 – Reducing inequality

SDG 15 – Preserving life on land

SDG 16 – Upholding peace, justice and strong institutions

A hungry nation

India’s worst performance was towards SDG 2: Ending hunger by 2030, where its score has fallen to 38 in the current year from 48 in the previous year.

This was also highlighted by Global Hunger Index 2019 released in October 2019, which places India 102nd among 117 qualifying countries.

As many as 25 states and Union territories failed to address “hunger and malnutrition”, according to the NITI Ayog index. Jharkhand led from the bottom, scoring 22 off 100, followed by Madhya Pradesh (24) and Bihar (26).

Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh were among the states that lagged.

Top performer Goa scored 76, a dip of four points. Scores also dipped for five of the top 10 states: Manipur, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre-backed think tank considered three new indictors:

Children (6-59 months) who are anaemic

Children (0-4 years) who are underweight

Gross value added in agriculture per worker

Those apart, there were four existing indicators:

Rural households under public distribution system

Stunted children (under five)

Pregnant women (15-49 years) who are anaemic

Rice, wheat and coarse cereals produced annually per unit area

Climate challenge

The index recognised climate change as a challenge to ensuring food security in India as it turned food production highly vulnerable.

It stressed on climate-smart sustainable agriculture and called for widening climate-adaptive farming practices, new technology and plans that involve land owned by small farmers, who constitute more than 82 per cent of India’s farmers.

Poverty, gender parity

India slipped four points to 50 vis-a-vis ending poverty, with 22 states unable to reduce poverty. The situation was dismal for gender parity too.

Goa ranked last there, with its score plummeting 31 points to 19.

The index, in its second year, ranked the states and UTs based on 100 indicators for 54 targets across 16 goals.

The compendium features country case studies from Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru.

The ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems’ was launched at the Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration, which took place from 14-18 October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. In September 2019, a synthesis report of the six case studies was introduced at a side event during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

One billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation.

According to the compendium, current birth registration coverage is not adequate to meet SDG target 16.9, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. It reports that: the average birth registration rate globally is 73%; only 46% children in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered; and only 25% of the world population live in countries where more than 90% of the births and deaths are registered, most of these countries being high-income countries. The authors also note that according to the latest data from the World Bank, 1 billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation. The World Bank has also found that approximately 50% of the world’s deaths are not registered.

The compendium aims to provide evidence and raise awareness of the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management, where civil registration and identity management systems support each other. The publication is also aimed at shedding light, for civil registration authorities, of the opportunities for advancing CRVS and increasing registration coverage through tighter cooperation or integration with identity management systems and other “identity ecosystem” actors.

The compendium focuses on the experiences of six countries that have pursued a holistic approach to CRVS: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru. The case studies reflect varied experiences in building identity ecosystems with different constitutional and legal systems, administrative traditions and institutional arrangements. The studies present good practices, underlining how the countries’ different starting points were not an obstacle to building their identity system around a holistic approach, as well as their various ways of working.

Five recurring messages were identified across the six case studies:

A strong CRVS system that registers all vital events from birth until death for the whole population is an essential precondition for the implementation of a holistic identity system;

Other components of an identity ecosystem, including the issuance of identification credentials and functional government systems, rely on civil registration records as the only source of up-to-date identity data;

The digitization of CRVS and identity management systems, together with other government functional systems, enables more efficient ways for processing identity information;

The benefits of a holistic approach span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption and leaving no one behind; and

The four key elements essential to a conducive enabling environment for pursuing a holistic identity system are: political commitment; a legal framework that enables data sharing; a data privacy and protection framework; and technology ownership from the outset to mitigate possible vendor lock-in.

The six case studies (Armenia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru) also show that technical interoperability provides a range of benefits in ensuring that all categories of population from birth to death reflect their identity information in the system.

5,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/escwa-reports-on-progress-on-sdg-7-in-arab-region/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ESCWA Reports on Progress on SDG 7 in Arab Region,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) has published a report tracking progress made on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) at the regional and country levels through the indicators of energy access, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).

The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.

According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.

The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.

However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.

The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:

equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;

ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;

update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;

strengthen regional cooperation; and

promote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.

The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities.

6,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wef-and-pwc-report-makes-the-business-case-for-nature/,"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WEF and PwC Report Makes the Business Case for Nature,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has released the first in a series of three New Nature Economy (NNE) reports to be published this year. The series will make the case for why the nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy; identify a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation; and scope the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges.

Titled ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ the first report presents four chapters discussing the nature emergency, the risks of nature loss to businesses, how to manage these risks, and how to take action. The publication’s appendix offers an approach to modelling nature dependency for countries and sectors.

In their foreword, Dominic Waughray, Managing Director, Managing Board, World Economic Forum and Celine Herweijer, Global Leader, Innovation and Sustainability, PwC, United Kingdom, note that “every industry sector has some degree of direct and indirect dependency on nature” and identify nature loss as a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.” They point out that pursuing a “nature-positive way of doing business” can mitigate future economic and societal shocks.

Nature loss is a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.”

The report goes on to discuss how risks to nature manifest as risks to business across all sectors. They highlight the report’s findings, which indicate “that $44 trillion of economic value generation – more than half of the world’s total GDP – is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and is therefore exposed to nature loss.”

The report follows on the heels of the WEF’s Global Risks Report, which for the first-time in the report’s 10-year history listed the top five risks in terms of likelihood as environmental.

The NNE series, which is produced in collaboration with PwC, is being developed under the umbrella of the WEF’s Nature Action Agenda, a platform for mobilization and support in the lead up to the UN Biodiversity Conference in October 2020, at which time a new global biodiversity framework is expected to be adopted.

The framework “builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020” and aims to bring about a “transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled.”

The ‘Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’ requested at its first meeting that a zero draft text of the global biodiversity framework be provided six weeks prior to its second meeting, which will be held 24-28 February in Kunming, China.

Speaking on the zero draft, the Open Working Group Co-chairs, Basile Van Havre and Francis Ogwal, pointed out that they, “tried to create a framework for all, one that sets the stage for an inspirational, ambitious, realistic, and achievable framework.”

The proposed framework, published on 13 January, comprises background information, an introduction, and a draft recommendation for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting. These are followed by two annexes the contain, respectively, the initial draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the consideration of the Working Group, and elements of a draft recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifteenth meeting. The document is complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework and a glossary of terms.

The framework presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and each of these goals has an associated outcome for 2030. The five goals address net loss and ecosystem resilience; reductions in the percentage of species threatened with extinction; the maintenance and enhancement of genetic diversity; the benefits of nature to people; and increasing the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five goals. The 20 targets are presented under the categories of reducing threats to biodiversity; meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming.

The draft includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. It considers elements of guidance on goals, SMART targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss and for achieving transformational change. It also “takes into account the various consultation processes that have been undertaken, including the views expressed during the informal briefing by the Co-Chairs on 24 November 2019, which presented a preliminary overview of the zero draft of the framework.”

The Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

At an informal briefing on 19 December 2019, Mohammed recalled that the September 2019 high-level week had “provided a wake-up call” that efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda are not reaching the needed scale to bring about the “deep transformative change” required. The Decade of Action is an opportunity to course-correct, she said, noting that it is a priority for the Secretary-General, with “special amplification around climate action and gender equality.”

Mohammed highlighted three specific needs for the Decade of Action, noting that the plans follow consultations “across the system and with stakeholders from civil society, business, the arts, academia and beyond.” The first need is to rethink the narrative about the connection between the SDGs and the issues that young people care about, and to pursue the right communication strategies. These include harnessing the power of the media, community leaders and local influencers, strengthening engagement with national parliaments, business and local governments, and developing new relationships.

The second area for action during the Decade is to raise ambition. Among the ways to do this, Mohammed highlighted:

Strengthen nationally determined contributions on climate change action (NDCs) at the 2020 session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26) in Glasgow, UK;

Demonstrate commitment and increased ambition in the context of international meetings in 2020 on gender equality, biodiversity, the ocean and sustainable transport;

Review national development plans and financing frameworks to ensure the needed magnitude of change; and

Translate existing SDG engagement by businesses, cities, and the finance community into clear and measurable action.

Mohammed also noted the upcoming reviews of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), saying the reviews could yield a “new wave of voluntary national reviews” (VNRs). A new approach to the VNRs, she indicated, could showcase the milestones governments will pursue between now and 2030.

Finally, the Deputy Secretary-General underlined the need for solutions that deliver concrete results for those most in need, in particular solutions that catalyze progress on multiple SDGs at the same time. She said the Decade of Action will prioritize such solutions. Some examples are: improving renewable energy-related battery technology; increasing access to finance for climate-vulnerable countries; removing fossil fuel subsidies; and creating a new consensus on sustainable food. Mohammed said the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) will provide inspiration for these solutions through its “entry points” for transformative change. The Decade of Action also will build on the UN Secretary-General’s Strategy on Financing the 2030 Agenda, she said.

On the SDG moment, Mohammed reminded participants that the political declaration of the SDG Summit calls for an SDG moment to take place annually during the high-level week of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), each September until 2030. She said the Moment will highlight successes and identify where more action is needed. It is expected to:

Provide a snapshot of what is and is not working, where more action is needed, how to do so. This component will draw on data, analytics, innovation and technology.

Showcase the best SDG solutions that have been adopted by governments and other stakeholders.

Keep SDGs at top of political agenda, to complement the engagement and analysis conducted by the annual sessions of the HLPF.

The first SDG moment will take place in September 2020, either in conjunction with the high-level meeting to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary, on 21 September, or on the opening day of the UNGA’s general debate for the 75th session, on 22 September.

According to a press release by the WEF, “for the first time in the survey’s 10-year outlook, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood are all environmental.” The Global Risks Report informs the WEF’s multi-stakeholder initiatives throughout the year.

The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.

The report frames the global economy as facing increased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.

The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.

The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.

Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.

The World Economic Forum will convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

10,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/buildings-and-construction-a-sleeping-giant-for-climate-action/,"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Buildings and Construction: A Sleeping Giant for Climate Action,"In the building sector, all trends are pointing upwards, with dramatic consequences for the climate. By 2060, the global building floor area is expected to double. Emerging and developing economies in warm and tropical climates will experience the biggest increase.

Already today, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sector consumes over a third of global final energy. Energy demand from the building sector is expected to grow by another 50% by 2050. Space cooling is a key driver of this demand – energy needs for space cooling are expected to triple.

Buildings cause greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both when they are built, and over their long lifetime of 30 to 80 years. Our modern way of constructing is mostly based on concrete, using standard blueprints regardless of the climate. This leads to high energy bills for those who can afford it, and economic and health risks for those who cannot.

Future-proofing Buildings Can Drive SDGs 1, 7, 11

Energy-efficient buildings are not rocket science. Improvements in the building’s outer structure and appliances can achieve substantial energy savings compared to standard buildings. Measures to future-proof buildings can range from “low-tech,” such as painting roofs in light colors and ensuring natural shade, to digital solutions for building design and management. Additional macro-economic benefits include energy security, job creation and health. And from a business perspective future proofed buildings have a lower lifetime cost and higher asset values.

Climate action in buildings and construction is among the most cost-effective measures. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that realizing the potential of sustainable buildings will save USD 1.1 trillion by 2050.

Nevertheless, this transition requires a shift in investment. USD 4.5 trillion are invested into real estate every year. To channel this investment towards energy efficiency, we need to influence it from two directions: ambitious policy and regulation serving as a “stick,” and financing as a “carrot.”

The Programme for Energy Efficiency in Buildings (PEEB), a French-German initiative, works with its first five partner countries – Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Vietnam – to transform the building sector. PEEB combines financing energy efficiency in large-scale projects with technical assistance through policy advice. PEEB mobilizes innovative financing solutions for large building projects. For example, in Morocco PEEB supports the government in mobilising EUR 20 million in climate financing for a residential housing programme. A green loan programme for young families is in the making in Vietnam. The programme also works with partners to make policies and standards more ambitious and effective, through better enforcement of existing green building codes or setting standards for sectors like hotels or hospitals.

All of these advancements are helping to achieve 2030 Agenda targets on energy, housing and poverty.

Climate Action in the Building Sector is Gaining Momentum

Another international agreement – the Paris Agreement on climate change – also hangs in the balance; its goals will not be achieved without a climate focus for buildings in the new decade. A rapid decarbonization needs to happen in the building sector, driven by international and national actors.

In 2019, action on buildings took center stage. Led by the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), buildings featured prominently at the climate change conference COP25 in Madrid, with topics ranging from zero carbon buildings to circular economy approaches in the buildings sector. The Global Status Report on Buildings and Construction confirmed the urgent need for action in the building sector. At the Climate Action Summit convened by the United Nations in September 2019, the Net Zero Carbon initiative was launched to leverage the leadership of governments, industry and civil society to commit to ambitious targets and mobilize funding. The Cool Coalition and SEforALL’s Cooling for All initiative have incorporated buildings as a key element of their strategies.

As we head into 2020, buildings are high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has named moving towards zero carbon buildings as one of its four top priorities for tackling climate change. The report by the UK government on energy transitions features buildings as a key sector. The lead-up to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) in 2020 has an unprecedented opportunity to raise the ambition of all actors to make our buildings future-proof and wake this sleeping giant.

11,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/2020s-buzzword-is-nature/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: 2020's Buzzword is Nature,"The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending. Relatable, universal, and cross-cutting, Nature will be a dominant and uniting theme for many of the milestone events leading up to the adoption of a new, post-2020 framework for biodiversity in October.

With half of humanity living in urban areas, where biodiversity often comes in the forms of roaches, rats, monkeys, and mosquitoes, any push to save the planet needs a concept everyone can embrace. The messaging this year will be broad and it will be accessible. From slum to skyscraper, Nature is all around. Air to breathe, fresh water and food. A stunning sunset. A vicious storm. Nature envelopes us, and for better or worse, it ‘leaves no one behind.’ Communications will encourage the reconnection of people to Nature, like for instance the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ (IPBES) emphasis on ‘Nature’s Contributions to People.’

Going into 2020, data show that we won’t achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Aichi Targets by their deadline in December. Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May. Last year, the IPBES Global Assessment of the State of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service report, which will serve as the scientific basis of the post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations, informed that approximately a million species are a risk of extinction and that nature continues to decline due to human activities. The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.

Perhaps a wider and softer net – one woven by Mother Nature herself – can help. Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies. This has long been a CBD priority, with the Convention dedicating its 2018 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors – recognizing that these sectors depend on nature’s contributions. Without a doubt, the plight of biodiversity must be universally understood and addressed, if humanity is to solve the ecological crisis. As the 2019 World Economic Forum, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund are saying, it’s time for a “New Deal for Nature.”

Further, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation has demanded an end to siloed development approaches and encouraged a focus on the linkages between the environmental, economic and social aspects of development. No more is biodiversity to be considered in a vacuum – not if it is to be truly integrated into the universally agreed, global development platform. Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework. Nature’s systems, of which biodiversity is a critical component, sustain life on Earth and offer a touchstone for the achievement of all the Goals. Nature is cross-cutting.

The theme for biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity.

When the CBD does convene its COP in October to adopt the post-2020 biodiversity framework, it will do so under the theme of ‘Ecological Civilizations: Building a Shared Future for all Life on Earth.’ Note that the theme for the biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity. Instead it links people (civilizations) to nature (ecology). Ecology is the branch of biology dealing with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. By its theme, the CBD COP won’t just be talking about conserving biodiversity for biodiversity’s sake. It will be talking about the core of humanity – our civilizations – and their relationship to the natural world all around. It is an approach that strikes an additional nail into the coffin of siloed approaches to conservation.

The other major biodiversity-related COP in 2020, that of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in February, will also have ecology at the heart of its theme. For its part, the CMS will present the concept of ‘Ecological Connectivity,’ which it defines as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.” With a concept that links the migration of species to the sustenance of all life on Earth, the CMS is calling for both an Ecological Connectivity stand-alone target as well as integration of the concept into other relevant targets of the new biodiversity framework.’ Will the bigger pictures sync? Can our “ecological civilizations” be “ecologically connected”?

In addition to ecology, nature-based solutions are also likely to feature in the big biodiversity-related and climate meetings this year. These approaches, which offer a linked way to incorporate biodiversity considerations into multidimensional development problems, rose to global attention in 2019. They were stressed in parallel to the Climate Action Summit, especially with regard to forests, as well as at the UN Convention on Desertification COP (UNCCD COP 14) and the High-level Panel on Oceans, during Climate Week. Nature-based solutions have been framed as a way to address multiple priorities at once – for instance mangroves offer protection from climate-related disasters like storm surges, while fostering the biodiversity that supports fisheries (food and employment) and sequestering carbon.

In announcing the theme of the next World Environment Day, which will take place in June 2020 and focus on biodiversity, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, “2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action.” It is likely that nature-based solutions will also receive attention at the forthcoming meetings of the World Conservation Congress, the second UN Ocean Conference, and the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

As a final point of reference for the 2020 word of the year, when world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they will have an opportunity to participate in a ‘Nature Summit.’ The meeting will offer one more step towards achieving the CBD’s long-term (2050) Vision of ‘Living in Harmony with Nature.’

We are all touched by her hand, and for the Biodiversity Super Year, we will see that our hope lies in Nature.","The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

The Peru study reports that after operating a disperse system of civil registration and an identification system closely tied to electoral purposes for more than 100 years, in 1993 Peru established a single national agency in charge of both functions, el Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil (RENIEC). Since then, RENIEC has articulated a decentralized system, increasing the coverage of vital events registration, identifying citizens, and integrating CRVS and identity management systems. The integration was realized through establishing standard processes and guidelines, introducing digital technology, and digitizing civil registration and identification records.

Throughout the integration process, RENIEC has increased collaboration between public and private organizations through the exchange of data, and has become Peru’s primary resource for identity authentication. The case study notes that, in order to make civil registration the backbone of identity management, RENIEC focused its efforts on:

Constitutional independence and autonomy;

Digitized records;

Information exchange between public and private sectors;

Integration strategies combined with information technology; and

Online services at health facilities for birth and death certification and registration.

To reflect the benefits of CRVS and ID management, the publication highlights the example of nutrition subsidies where the integration improved service provision and saved time and money: RENIEC has ensured that more newborns get nutrition support in time by reducing the application process from two months to 72 hours, and reaching 71% of beneficiaries within the first month, up from 36%.

As data gaps in registration still remain, especially related to the most vulnerable segments of the population, RENIEC has taken measures to improve services for Indigenous communities, set inter-institutional alliances and cooperation, and launch mobile registration units.

The publication also notes that, as part of the efforts to serve Indigenous communities, the Identity Restitution and Social Support Department is developing a project to provide customized training to civil registrars in Indigenous communities. As Peru has 48 Indigenous languages that are spoken by approximately 16% of the population, since 2014 RENIEC has worked to promote the use of Indigenous languages in civil registration services. The institution also provides an online registration platform, civil registry books, civil registration forms, dissemination and training material, and certified copies of civil registration records in Indigenous languages. These measures have helped reduce registration errors, promote inclusion, reduce under-registration, and contribute to reaching the SDG target 16.9.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia and Netherlands. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

The Barcelona Convention COP 21 took place from 2-5 December 2019, at the Castel dell’Ovo in Naples, Italy. Over 200 participants from the 22 Contracting Parties as well as representatives from UN agencies, international research organizations, multilateral development banks, the private sector, and civil society attended the four-day event.

Through the Naples Ministerial Declaration, Parties also committed to develop trans-disciplinary research and inter-sectoral policies to address climate change through a cross-cutting approach, particularly with regard to the water-food-energy nexus.

Aside of the Ministerial Declaration, some of the thematic decisions adopted at COP 21 included:

the common regional framework for integrated coastal zone management;

Mediterranean offshore guidelines and standards;

updated guidelines regulating the placement of artificial reefs at sea;

governance;

identification and conservation of sites of particular ecological interest in the Mediterranean; and

a road map for the possible designation of the Mediterranean Sea area as an emission control area for sulphur oxides pursuant to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, annex VI, within the framework of the Barcelona Convention.

During a ministerial session, Joyce Msuya, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), remarked that a recently concluded study found that there are about 62 million individual pieces of marine litter floating in the Mediterranean Sea, adding that progress on improving the marine environment in the Mediterranean region can serve as a powerful driving force towards achieving the SDGs.

In a video message, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, echoed the need to address the “plastic plague,” explaining that plastic has permeated the food chain to the point where we are “eating the consequences.” Gaetano Leone, UNEP, noted that the Barcelona Convention must be central to the events taking place during 2020, as the “super year” for the global development and biodiversity agendas.

In a High-Level Panel Discussion on Protecting the Marine Environment and Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, Gavin Edwards, Global Coordinator, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), called out the challenge of moving MPAs from ‘paper parks’ to areas of enforcement. He reiterated that 2020 will be a “super year” of opportunity for the planet given the second UN Ocean Conference and the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, adding that many sectors, including business and finance, are increasingly taking biodiversity and climate protection “more seriously.”

During the high-level discussion, delegates further highlighted the need to, inter alia: not scare people about the current climate situation but instead instill optimism; not underestimate the climate challenge; and to scale up efforts and restore science and evidence-based policies to increase confidence.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the publication, Armenia’s experience shows that the two building blocks of identity – CVRS and identity management – do not need to operate under one agency to be done successfully, but can work well even if different agencies are responsible, as long as the respective systems are interoperable so they can share information.

The case study highlights how the country’s Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for civil registration, and the Police have developed “a solid framework” for working together. The publication notes that Armenia’s modern CRVS is fully digitized, with all registered information being entered directly into the electronic civil register. This system enables the digital vital events records that belong to a specific person to be linked, so their up-to-date identity information is available any time. The identity management system is managed by the police, its population register being an electronic database that serves as the main tool to manage identity data and issue national ID cards and travel documents.

The country study also reports that each time a new birth is added to the civil register, the information that includes identity attributes of the newborn is automatically sent to the population register, where a new personal record is created. Also, every time a new vital event is registered and the names of informants are added to the civil register, this digitized platform automatically pulls identity information for the informants from the population register. This way, the publication explains, the two interoperable systems can provide up-to-date information to other users of identity data from these registers.

Some of the good practices identified in the Armenia case study include:

Digitizing civil registration processes to enable easier data sharing and registration of vital events;

Including an e-health platform that can be accessed at hospitals, where digital and paper-based medical certificates are produced;

Linking the civil and population registers electronically to the civil register to copy identity data of informants or applicants from the population register, instead of copying that data from an identification credential that a person presents; and

Using an innovative platform to verify if civil registration certificates and documents are authentic.

The publication highlights data interoperability among government-operated information and communications technology systems as essential to the effectiveness of the holistic approach taken with regards to the CRVS and identity management systems, as it allows the government to decide which types of data each service can access. The text explains that when a nation-wide layer of data interoperability was added, specific procedures were instituted to regulate cooperation between the two agencies.

Overall, Armenia’s framework to fully digitize government services by 2030 focuses on cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, government efficiency, tech-oriented private sector, and tech-savvy workforce. According to the framework, once the proposed E-Gov is fully in place, it will reduce the cost of government services by 50%, significantly reduce corruption and increase competitiveness, and add up to 3% to the growth rate of Armenia’s gross domestic product.

According to the case study, like most countries that emerged from the former Soviet Union, Armenia inherited a well-developed system for registering vital events, thus investment was needed for the system’s digitization, which was done with support from the EU. The total amount invested in digitizing so far is estimated at around USD 2 million, with the digitizing of historical records being estimated at USD 1 for each vital event record.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

The NDC Support Facility for Efficient, Climate-Friendly Cooling was launched on 27 January 2020, by the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (K-CEP), a philanthropic initiative to support the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, with a focus on the energy efficiency of cooling. The new Facility will advance cooling solutions in a way that complements the Kigali Amendment, which aims to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

The K-CEP press release explains that the demand for cooling is expected to rise dramatically with the anticipated rise in global temperatures, and the global energy demand for air conditioning will triple by 2050. More efficient, climate-friendly options for cooling are needed; otherwise, K-CEP says, “the emissions from cooling could use up most of the remaining carbon budget required to achieve the Paris target of staying below a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures within the next few decades.”

The NDC Support Facility plans to award up to USD 12 million to organizations to provide technical assistance and other support to eligible Article 5 countries (including Kigali Amendment Group 2 countries such as India) that are making new cooling commitments in their strengthened NDCs for COP 26. Up to USD 5 million of this total is earmarked for proposals requesting technical assistance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to improve the energy efficiency of air-conditioning equipment, and USD 3.2 million will be dedicated to helping communities that are most at risk from a lack of access to cooling.

The Global Compact on Refugees was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 2018.

More than 3,000 representatives of governments, the UN system, civil society and the private sector as well as 70 refugees participated in the Forum, which convened from 17-18 December 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was organized by the governments of Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan and Turkey, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was co-hosted by the government of Switzerland.

Delivering opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recalled that during his experiences as the High Commissioner for Refugees he saw “a fundamental human trait: the will to kindness” and the impulse to help a person in trauma. He said he also learned that generosity is not always proportional to wealth, and “the world owes all countries and communities that welcome large numbers of refugees a debt of gratitude” as well as the shouldering of that responsibility. He said the UN will advocate for including refugees in regional frameworks and national development plans and reviews, as well as in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.

The Forum reported the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced, including through employment, legal support and education.

UNHCR Filippo Grandi linked the Forum to the SDGs’ goal of leaving no one behind. He said refugee situations only become crises through short-term thinking, failing to work together across sectors, and neglecting the communities where refugees arrive.

The Forum had six areas of focus: burden and responsibility sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; solutions; and protection capacity. Each area was supported by a coalition of co-sponsors who formed alliances of support and advocacy, and identified opportunities for making pledges and contributions. More than 30 “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” consultations took place at the country and regional levels to identify possible pledges and contributions.

The Forum’s official summary reports that around 770 pledges and contributions were submitted during the event by a broad range of actors, including governments, humanitarian actors, private sector entities, educational institutions and international organizations. This composition of supporters represents “a considerable increase” in the level of engagement of many states and organizations in the Global Compact’s implementation. Per the summary, more than 350 pledges relate to improving laws and policies, such as pledges to:

continue to receive and admit refugees;

adopt “out of camp” policies and strengthen asylum systems;

allow refugees and asylum seekers to work and access financial services; and

include refugees in countries’ national development planning and national systems for education and health.

The summary also notes a commitment “to further and deeper engagement” by development actors and multilateral development banks, expressed through a range of financing and policy instruments, with almost 250 pledges containing “some form of financial component.” An initial analysis presented in the Forum’s summary indicates: USD 2.2 billion pledged by the World Bank Group, through a dedicated funding and financing window for refugees and host communities, in addition to a separate window of USD 2.5 billion aimed at supporting private sector investment in creating jobs in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence; USD 1 billion committed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); and over USD 2 billion in financial commitments by “a broad range of States and other stakeholders.”

The Global Refugee Forum also registered more than 200 pledges and contributions from the private sector, representing “the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced.” These commitments include more than USD 250 million in funding, the direct employment of more than 15,000 refugees, a joint legal community pledge with NGOs to provide more than 125,000 hours of pro bono legal services per year, and other pledges related to education and training, women’s economic empowerment, connectivity, business development services and innovative financing.

By the Forum’s summary, more than 130 pledges were made towards expanding access to education for refugees, focusing on supporting the inclusion of refugees in national systems.

The good practices, pledges and contributions announced during the Forum are featured on a digital platform launched at the Forum. The Platform will continue to collect and share good practices.

The first Global Refugee Forum also featured the launch of Support Platforms to reinforce three regional refugee responses, namely the MIRPS in Central America and Mexico, the Nairobi Process facilitated by The Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the East and Horn of Africa, and the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. The Support Platforms are situation-specific arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing provided for in the Global Compact on Refugees. Their purpose is to galvanize political commitment, mobilize assistance, facilitate coherent humanitarian and development responses, and support comprehensive policy initiatives.

Other launches at the Forum included the Asylum Capacity Support Group and the Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network, which seek to make the best use of, build upon and expand existing knowledge and expertise on refugee protection, in support of the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees. The UN Development Programme presented its SDG Impact Accelerator (SDGIA), launched with the Government of Turkey, which aims to accelerate entrepreneurs for market-creating innovations that tackle the challenges of refugee populations and host communities in Turkey. Subsequently, SDGIA’s solutions and best practices could be replicated and applied to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

The Forum was preceded by a day of special events dedicated to the refugee cause. It was supported by a social media campaign that emphasized that #EveryoneCounts.

UNHCR has developed a mechanism to track the implementation of pledges and contributions, and the next Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2023. A mid-term review meeting in 2021 also will serve as a tool to assess progress and maintain momentum for implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees.","The first-ever Global Refugee Forum – an opportunity to “rally behind the aspirations of the SDGs of leaving no one behind” – generated hundreds of pledges and contributions towards implementing the Global Compact on Refugees.

Councillors have questioned Chandigarh’s performance in this category.

In what comes as a surprise, Chandigarh emerged as an achiever with perfect 100 in the parameter of sanitation in SDG Index 2019 report among all other states and Union Territories. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-India Index report 2019 was released two days ago.

While Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana, Bihar, Haryana and others have emerged front-runners, according to the report, Chandigarh has emerged as the achiever above all these states in the SDG goal of ‘clean water and sanitation’.

In the SDG goal, it is mentioned that the flagship initiative of the Swachh Bharat Mission covering all rural and urban areas has successfully achieved the target of making India open defacation-free (ODF) by October 2, 2019. The parameter includes conversion of unsanitary toilets to pour-flush toilets, eradication of manual scavenging, municipal solid waste management, raising awareness and nudging positive behavioural change in people.

Councillors have questioned Chandigarh’s performance in this category. “This is surprising. How can the city, performance of which is going down can be the achiever with perfect score? Maybe the corporation is fudging the data and sending wrong feedback,” Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla said.

Another councillor, Satish Kainth, said that it should be checked who provided the details on municipal waste management to the government.

“The officials of sanitation wing are not revealing actual details. Even as they say that their public toilets are in the best condition, one should just go and see there are no facilities and water is also not available,” Kainth said.

Questioning the claim of ‘open defecation-free’ status by the corporation, former mayor Subhash Chawla said that it is being falsely said that the city is among ODF plus plus cities.

“The situation is starkly different from what they are claiming. There are several colonies which don’t even have any public toilets. All this is just a sham,” Chawla said.

Chandigarh emerged as the top performer among the Union Territories in the SDG goals with a total score of 70. Among the states, Kerala emerged as the front runner with a score of 70.","Councillors have questioned Chandigarh’s performance in this category.

In his essay, Belay Begashaw, Director-General of the Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, highlights that progress so far on the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals, and targets and notes the need to redouble efforts. He emphasizes the importance of localizing the SDGs and integrating them within the local, national, and regional planning processes including the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

In the past four years, we have slid at least 15 notches on the UN Sustainable Development Goals index. The country ranked 115th in 2016, went down to 117th in 2017, and then to 122nd in 2018 before reaching the 130th spot in 2019. Sadly, considering the strained economy, poor governance and high inflation, the living conditions of millions of Pakistanis will only get worse. It is ironic that Pakistan was among the first countries that translated the Millennium Development Goals into national goals and came up with a detailed framework for achieving them. However, Pakistan had missed several major goals related to health and climate by the conclusion of the MDG time frame in 2015. Similarly, after the Sustainable Development Summit of 2015, Pakistan was again one of the first countries to adopt the 2030 agenda through a resolution in the National Assembly. Yet, despite the allocation of resources, foreign aid and much activity in bureaucratic circles, the country continues to perform badly in several areas, the challenges ranging from malnutrition to education inequality. In the latest Human Development Report, Pakistan is ranked at 152, marginally below all other South Asian countries, not least because of the complexity of the developmental challenges it faces and its poor response to them.

What we lack are proper resources, political will, competent personnel and empowered local governments, while bureaucratic delays, corruption and mismanagement have worsened matters. Unfortunately, development to policymakers is an ‘outside’ problem to be tackled by academics and development agencies. What seems to be missing is the realisation that development indicators also expose ineffective governance. The success of any parallel or overarching development scheme will always remain limited if governance weakens the implementation of goals. For example, the introduction of the Sehat Sahulat Card that aims to provide health insurance is a laudable step by the PTI government, but unless a serious effort is made to improve the quality of drinking water — polluted water is a major source of disease — the initiative will remain ineffective because of rising health costs. Similarly, eradicating poverty and hunger will be difficult without a reduction in food prices. The challenges for the present government are enormous. But solutions might be simpler than expected — if the decision-makers are willing to make amends.

20,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-s-top-films-of-2019-sry8eg5a,"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG’s Top Films of 2019,"Religious themes graced an unusual number of notable films in 2019, which our critic says may be the best movie year of the decade — with one notable caveat.

An exquisite art-house film about a beatified martyr. The triumphant arrival of a belated documentary of a celebrated gospel concert. A fact-based drama about an alliance of devout and unbelieving survivors of clerical sex abuse calling for justice.

These are just a few of an unusually large crop of notable films that tackled religious and spiritual themes in 2019.

Prayer, clerical characters, and church services and liturgical celebrations featured in several films, from the baptism and confession scenes in Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman to Tom Hanks’ Mr. Rogers praying for all the members of the Vogel family by name in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.

There was a revisionist Jesus indie. A Harriet Tubman biopic that treated Tubman’s faith and mystical experiences as a kind of superpower. A documentary about an influential priest who served on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and marched with Martin Luther King Jr.

There were also, of course, a number of faith-based films, produced within the “Christian film” industry. Among these were the fact-based medical-miracle drama Breakthrough, the sports movie Overcomer and the abortion-themed conversion story Unplanned, based on Abby Johnson’s memoir.

All of these were embraced by the faithful and did well at the box office, though like most faith-based films they continued the trend of preaching to the choir.

The revered filmmaker Terrence Malick is a Christian and the religious themes in his work are very deliberate, but his films speak powerfully to cinephiles of other faiths and of none. His latest celebrates the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter, a devout Austrian Catholic executed in 1943 for refusing to swear the soldier’s oath of allegiance to Hitler, and declared a martyr and beatified in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI.

A somewhat different case: In cataloguing the horrors of China’s crimes against humanity, the critically acclaimed documentary One Child Nation bears startling witness to the human dignity of discarded fetuses found in alleys and garbage dumps, above all in the work of the visual artist Peng Wang, the film’s most eloquent voice of conscience.

I found this the most powerfully pro-life message on American screens in 2019, though the filmmakers didn’t set out to make a statement about abortion itself. On the contrary, late in the film is a glib throwaway line unconvincingly comparing efforts to restrict abortion in the U.S. with China’s policies of forced abortions and sterilizations.

Still, the film’s unavoidable pro-life implications have caused discomfort, perhaps even cognitive dissonance, among some of its supporters. At Sundance a leading New York film critic, while acknowledging the film’s achievements, expressed concern about how the U.S. “extreme right” might respond to it — an indication, for me, of the film’s moral power.

In some cases, on the other hand, religious themes were downplayed or omitted entirely where they might be expected. For example, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, though a delightful film and a fascinating commentary on Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel, omits essentially every scrap of the source material’s religiosity while adding a shocking line about God’s will in relation to an impending tragedy.

A Beautiful Day includes Mr. Rogers’ faith and prayer but omits the larger role of prayer in the source material. Tolkien could hardly help including the youthful Tolkien’s clerical guardian, but it subverts his relationship with Tolkien and otherwise ignores the role of Catholicism in Tolkien’s life, including its direct relationship to his mother’s ostracism from her family.

2019 was another banner year for Disney dominance. With the combined power of its Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm brands, the Mouse released seven of the year’s top 10 box-office hits domestically, including Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. (That’s not counting Spider-Man: Far From Home, which Disney got a piece of but was released by Sony. Rounding out the top 10 were Warner Bros’ Joker and It Chapter Two.)

None of these branded IP releases were among my favorite films of the year, but that wasn’t very surprising or disappointing.

More disappointing was the dearth of high-quality family films. Original content especially was lacking amid a parade of sequels (Lego Movie 2, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World) and remakes (The Lion King, Aladdin, Dumbo).

Movies often come in twos, but this year there were a trio (!) of abominable-snowman cartoons — none very good. What else? Among the odds and ends, the most diverting were a hand-drawn Santa Claus origin story (see my honorable mentions) and a live-action Arthurian fantasy adventure called The Kid Who Would Be King from Attack the Block director Joe Cornish. (Toy Story 4 also was good, not great.)

In a way it was a year for trios. In a great year for nonfiction films, a trio of archival “time machine” documentaries that brought the past to startling new life were all so miraculous that ranking them was practically meaningless. (In the end, lacking anything else to go by, my deciding factors were subject matter and emotions: I would rather think about space travel than war, and I would rather think about God than anything.)

Among the year’s popular high-profile releases a trio of auteur-driven throwbacks to classic Hollywood genres with a twist — the whodunit, the “women’s picture” and the gangster movie — had me cheering.

But I was disappointed by the trio I had been most looking forward to: three acclaimed original films — The Lighthouse, The Nightingale and Us — each the sophomore effort of a director whose wildly original horror feature debut (respectively, The Witch, The Babadook and Get Out) set a high bar.

Among other acclaimed films I wasn’t over the moon for, I was dazzled by the brilliant filmmaking of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, but after reading scads of raves I remain unsold on the ending. And I was crushed not to love Clemency, a movie that, on paper, ought to have been a shoo-in for my top five, or even my top three.

Still, going just by the quality of the films in my top 10 (and the difficulty I had eliminating many worthy runners-up that I would have been just as happy including in the top 10), I might call 2019 the best overall movie year of the 2010s — with the caveat that family audiences were underserved.

When I first saw the harrowing Syrian documentary The Cave I was sure it would be in my top 10, until it was displaced by For Sama. How is it possible that For Sama didn’t make the top 10 either? How did Aquarella, from the Russian documentarian whose quietly delightful ¡Vivan Las Antipodas! rounded out my 2013 top 10, land in my honorable mentions? Perhaps most astonishingly to me, why is Marriage Story not in my top five, let alone my top 10?

That’s how good the films were this year.

At any rate, this is my list of the 30 films that most moved, thrilled, inspired, shook or haunted me in 2019. If your favorites aren’t listed below, it’s not because I “forgot” them, although, as always, there are many films I have yet to catch up with and others I wish I had enjoyed more than I did.

SDG’s Top Films of 2019

A Hidden Life. The moral themes of dramas of martyrdom and conscience like A Man for All Seasons and Sophie Scholl blend with Terrence Malick’s signature themes of theodicy and paradise lost in this ecstatic, anguished three-hour cinematic hymn singing the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter. Malick’s most linear film in years is also his most overtly religious and most political, with challenges for both believing and secular admirers. Violence and menace; thematic content. Mature teens.

One Child Nation. The psychological and cultural toll as well as the human-rights atrocities of China’s war on the family are laid bare in Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang’s daring first-person stealth documentary. Juxtaposing Wang’s memories of growing up in the one-child era with revealing interviews and archival materials, it’s a furiously controlled blend of political indictment, cultural cross-examination and personal journey. Frank discussion of atrocities, including forced abortions; some disturbing images; brief language. Mature teens.

Amazing Grace. Sydney Pollack’s long-unfinished film of Aretha Franklin’s 1972 gospel concert with the Southern California Community Choir at L.A.’s New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, completed at last by producer Alan Elliott, is at once an exuberant celebration of music and showmanship and also a transcendent act of worship. Nothing problematic.

The Farewell. A gorgeous and winning cross-cultural comedy-drama about an extended Chinese family going to unusual lengths to gather around a dying matriarch who doesn’t know she’s dying, Lulu Wang’s semi-autobiographical film finds universal truths in the tale of a very specific lie. A Shinto ritual; brief crass language; heavy drinking and inebriation; mature themes. Teens and up.

Light from Light. Loss, mystery and the pursuit of meaning are recurring themes in Paul Harrill’s subdued indie dramas set in East Tennessee. His latest, starring Marin Ireland and Jim Gaffigan, is a whisper-quiet ghost story that, while not overtly religious, implicitly raises questions about discerning the voice of God speaking to us. Mature themes; a brief medical scare. Teens and up.

Apollo 11. Long-neglected high-definition NASA film reels and brilliant editing offer genuinely new, wondrous access to one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements in Todd Douglas Miller’s masterful documentary. Brief language. Kids and up.

They Shall Not Grow Old. Voices and faces from the dim and distant past emerge with stunning vitality in Peter Jackson’s tour de force World War I documentary, which features cutting-edge digital restoration and colorization of archival footage. Graphic battlefield imagery. Adults.

Little Women. It’s still a feel-good celebration of family bonds and moral virtue, but Greta Gerwig hasn’t just remade Louisa May Alcott’s often-adapted classic — she’s reimagined and reinterpreted it, interweaving the two halves of Alcott’s story and glossing the autobiographical significance of Saoirse Ronan’s Jo March. Brief inebriation; mature themes. Might be fine for older kids.

Knives Out. In Rian Johnson’s hands, an old-fashioned, ridiculously entertaining whodunit with all the usual elements becomes a morality tale with a distinctly contemporary vibe, rewarding decency and compassion, siding with the marginal over the privileged, and knocking the complacent on both sides of contemporary political discourse. Murder theme; a suicide; sexual references; frequent profanity and crude language. Teens and up.

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

“We live here, we work here, we raise our families here, we want what’s best for our community,” he told council members. “In our last visit, we explained the program. There were some questions I understand, that were raised after our presentation. So I just wanted to address a couple of points.”

OPP Const. Jim Blanchette was back before council to provide clarifications regarding the proposed partnership between the SDG OPP and the Mental Health Crisis Team (MHCT) at the Cornwall Community Hospital.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Although council had initially expressed support for the partnership, most members had also outlined they didn’t want SDG to finance the project on a yearly basis, citing that doing so should be the provincial government’s mandate.

The future of the proposed OPP mobile crisis response team was cemented during an SDG council meeting Monday.

In order to solidify his point, Blanchard pointed to a specific case in Winchester, where, two years ago prior to an intervention from the OPP and community partners, a woman had been involved in 128 calls for service.

“Since we’ve had the intervention, we’ve only had one interaction with her,” said Blanchette. “I could go on and on and on about the benefits shown across the province with this type of community team response. I think it’s important to note that this proposal is actually an extension to the police services board.

“You have an opportunity to reduce your police services budget in a reduction of calls for service.”

Despite Blanchard’s claims, some elected officials were still skeptical of who would end up having to finance the request.

“My fear is that if we fund this this year, will you be coming back every year,” said Coun. Bryan McGillis. “It adds up to a lot after 10 years. Are you going to be back next year with the same amount?”

“It certainly not our intention to make this request every year,” answered Blanchette. “If this program gets off the ground, then we won’t need to come back.”

Coun. Tony Fraser, on the other hand, expressed how he felt SDG was often overlooked by the provincial government.

“I don’t doubt the cost saving or the benefit this could have for our community,” said Fraser. “My struggle is not a struggle with this project. My struggle is with the province. Sometimes I feel that as members of the SDG council, we’re neglected and it is a struggle to find the funds that we need to keep everything working.”

A supporter of the proposal since its initial pitch, Coun. Kirsten Gardner urged her fellow council members to support the initiative.

“We’re going to invest $100,000 in a newspaper digitization project,” she said. “History doesn’t save lives.”

The $120,000 was added to the 2020 budget. SDG council will return to budget deliberations in February.

In a ranking of states released last week by Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog and the United Nations, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially in poverty alleviation and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh sank to the bottom of the list.According to the SDG India Index 2019, India’s composite score improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20 with successes in water and sanitation, power and industry. Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.Kerala retained the top slot while Bihar came out as the worst performer. Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100, where it fully achieves its SDGs. Himachal Pradesh ranked next with 69 due its clean water and sanitation efforts, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among the union territories (UTs), Chandigarh topped at 68 due to its focus on clean water and sanitation and providing quality education.Tamil Nadu also topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.As per the SDG India Index 2019, the composite score for each state/UT is computed by aggregating their performance across the goals, and then by taking the arithmetic mean of individual goal scores. A score of 100 implies that the State/ UT has achieved targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that the particular State/UT is at the bottom of the table. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim have shown maximum improvement, as per the report for second year released by NITI Aayog on Monday. This first such report was released in 2018.The year 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by 193 countries at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The Index has been developed by NITI Aayog in coordination with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute.In 2018 index, only three states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, were placed in the category of front runners – with a score in the range of 65-99. In 2019, five more States joined this league – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Sikkim and Goa, taking the total tally to eight.With regard to poverty reduction, states which have done well include Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim. On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. It is designed to function as a tool for focused policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, and moving towards development action pegged to globally recognizable metrics. The Index also supplements NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts to encourage evidence-based policymaking by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and sharing best practices.The 2019 Index is more robust than the first edition on account of wider coverage of goals, targets, and indicators. It spans 16 out of 17 SDGs with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels. Further, the Index highlights the need for improvements in data collection, reporting and methodology. Partnerships for disaggregating data and developing capacity for real-time monitoring and measuring incremental progress are also being explored.","Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its rapid improvements in health facilities, gender equality and quality education.

New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG

Article content Despite Ontario’s Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act replacing and repealing the previous Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) Act, it will be business as usual at the Ontario SPCA Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Animal Centre in Cornwall. “The society and its network of animal-welfare communities will continue to facilitate and provide for provincewide leadership on matters relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals and the promotion of animal well-being,” said Melissa Kosowan, associate director of communications for the OSPCA provincial office. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG Back to video When asked about the act and how it might affect the SDG office, branch manager Carol Link said, “(the act) is different from what we do, sheltering. It’s two different departments.” PAWS, the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada, will oversee a variety of different categories. The province is implementing a new model with more inspectors to provide provincewide coverage, including those with specialized expertise in livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines.

Article content In addition, the act enables courts to impose the highest financial penalties for offenders in Canada and update prohibitions and obligations, such as barring the return of dog fighting equipment to a person convicted of an offence, and harming or attempting to harm a service animal or one that works with peace officers. The act will provide a more aggressive way of tackling animal abuse, something which the Ontario SPCA did to a lesser extent. “It’s important to remember that enforcement made up only approximately 20 per cent of the work the Ontario SPCA does every day in animal protection,” said Kosowan. “As Ontario’s animal welfare charity, we offer a variety of mission-based programs, including community-based sheltering, animal wellness services, provincial animal transfers, shelter health and wellness, high-volume spay/neuter services, animal rescue, animal advocacy, Indigenous partnership programs and humane education.” The act will also establish a multi-disciplinary advisory table made up of a wide range of experts, including veterinarians, agriculture representatives, academics, animal advocates and others to provide ongoing advice to the ministry. “People care about the welfare of animals and so does our government,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. “We committed to creating a strong, new system to protect animals, and we have delivered on that promise.”

Article content PAWS will also introduce a new enforcement model, made up of a chief animal welfare inspector, locally deployed provincial inspectors and specialized inspectors for livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines. What is unknown at the moment is whether those inspectors who worked for the OSPCA – one was based here in SDG – remain employed under the new service. Inspectors will conduct outreach and education on animal care best practices and how to be compliant with the legislation, proactive, risk-based inspections; including, for example, of zoos and aquariums and reactive inspections to respond to animal welfare concerns The new approach will also provide resources for Crown attorneys to support animal welfare prosecutions. The province has established a toll-free number, 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625) for people to report concerns about animal distress or abuse. This call centre is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. fracine@postmedia.com Twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Article content Poverty is the most-persistent social ill in all of human history, and anyone who tries to solve it has always faced an uphill battle. Nonetheless, the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being Plan created for Cornwall, Akwesasne, and the United Counties of SDG has made poverty reduction one of its four main pillars.

The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation.

Article content Advocacy The plan starts off by proposing the region begin a campaign advocating for several changes that have been championed by anti-poverty activists in recent years. These include either free or affordable tuition and access to nutritious food; a more generous social assistance that allows recipients to begin to build up savings; and, for local employers to begin paying a living wage. Labossiere said the United Ways in Perth and Huron are currently leaders on the living-wage issue. Not only do those organizations pay their employees living wages, they highlight businesses in their communities who do the same. “It’s like: they are a gold business because they pay their employees a living wage. It’s a community rating system for businesses, if you will. It’s been quite influential, and it is something that could be moved over,” she said. Adult education Education and retraining are often put forward as ways to break the cycle of poverty by giving people more options in their lives. The plan says a culture of volunteerism should be promoted as a way to help people build their qualifications while helping the community. It also proposes more interactive and accessible education to meet people’s needs and diverse learning styles, as well as an educational resource list. Expanding literacy training and employment preparedness courses is another proposal, which are things already being done by the Tri-County Literacy Council. Labossiere said the United Way already supports the council with its grants, but one easy way to improve adult education in the region would be for more people and charities to do the same.

Article content Programs for the working poor This initiative proposes working with existing agencies and people with lived experience to find gaps in the support system for people just barely getting by and then coming up with collaborative solutions. One of the biggest problems Labossiere sees is how the current system punishes poor families who start making more money “We are fortunate to live in a community that has fantastic accessibility levels for families with low revenues. There is low or free access to child care and summer camps, but then there’s that red line that if you make more than this amount, you no longer qualify,” she said. “Many families are still in the working poor category when they are just above that line. “So how can we break down barriers to participation for families in that grey area?” Prevention initiatives Preventing poverty can be easier than getting people out of its insidious cycle, so the community well-being plan proposes more prevention initiatives be created, targeted specifically at children and youth. These include life skills workshops to teach things such as food preparation, laundry, sex education, good consumer practices, financial literacy, and budgeting. It also proposes creating homework help and breakfast programs as well as mentorship programs. Labossiere noted there is already a program being run by the French Catholic school board called L’Equipe Psycho-social that does many of these things for vulnerable students and could be used as a model.

Article content Housing issues Homelessness is another tricky issue to try to solve, but the plan proposes advocating for more supportive housing in the region for people with mental illnesses, disabilities, and other health needs. It also calls for ensuring that there is adequate social housing for low-income families and individuals. A sense of community “Isolation is a huge factor in breaking the cycle of poverty, it’s even a determinant of health. We have to see isolation that must be worked on,” said Labossiere. “Anything that gets people feeling like part of a community makes for a healthier community, and a healthier community is one where people are less reliant on services and more reliant on neighbours.” Ways to cut down on that feeling isolation include organizing block parties or affordable recreational activities, such as sports or summer camps. Realities of poverty Being poor has always come with a large stigma attached, but the plan aims to change that. Great strides have been made in reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the past several years, and by holding workshops, particularly with employers, the plan hopes to do something similar. “I think there’s a misconception on the part of people who have lived a privileged life about those who have to struggle,” said Labossiere. “What do you do when your rent is due, you need electricity, and your kids are always hungry? “If you are always in survival mode, how do you take time to stop to do financial planning or make a good investment? You don’t.’

Article content Expanding access In order to give people easier access to the services that are already available, the community well-being plan calls for looking at the implementation of more online and phone services, as well as working with providers on things such as flexible hours and transportation programs. Volunteer opportunities Local community organizations are always in need of volunteers, and the community well-being plan wants to see a culture of volunteerism take hold in the region. Labossiere said work on this is already underway with the creation of the new volunteer managers association and the revamping of the Volunteer Hub website, which will have postings for volunteerism opportunities in the region. Better co-ordination The plan calls for organizations to work more closely together to help as many people as efficiently as possible. This includes creating a community hub where several different services can be accessed under one roof. “It’s not about giving money to one agency, it’s about addressing one need and bringing as many people to the table as necessary to fix it,” she said. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/Alan_S_Hale

Article content GLEN WALTER — Community partners from the agricultural, culinary and cultural world, highlighted agri-tourism’s importance to the region on Jan. 9, during a networking evening at the Upper Canada Cider Company’s tasting room. Over 100 participants mingled and listened to several speeches from various governmental representatives, who all stressed their support for the cause. Several local businesses and farms were also represented, such as The Finch Market, the Springfield Farm and the Kirkview Farms. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Article content “I would love for SDG to have the same status as Prince Edward County (PEC),” she said. “We know the people will spend money and will travel for food experiences. Well, we have all that is needed here, to be every bit as glamorous and successful as PEC.” Clement went on to outline what she believed is a solid foundation to develop agri-tourism in the region. “We have competent cities and towns,” she said. “We have an experienced agricultural sector here. We have local entrepreneurs that are fierce and creative. This is a perfect recipe for agri-tourism.” The mayor concluded by promoting the city’s tourism development fund. The said fund exists in order to support entrepreneurs wanting to create an event, festival, project or even collaboration that would attract tourism to Cornwall. “The province has allowed us to set up a fund by collecting revenues through tourists that come here,” Clement said. “This sits in a fund and people apply to that fund. We want to make sure that the people understand that that fund is to support anything that is going to bring tourism to Cornwall, that result will nights stays and accommodations. “If it’s going to somehow benefit the City of Cornwall, then we want to hear about it.” Akwesasne’s District Chief Edward Roundpoint praised for his part the partnerships created between the region’s neighbouring communities.

It’s about bringing us all together. We will build on each other. Co-operation is the best thing that we can offer.” The mood in the Upper Canada Cider Company was best echoed by how Clement concluded her speech. As everyone avidly listened, she yelled out passionately: “forget PEC, here is to SDG!” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

28,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/brookings-report-reflects-on-africas-sdg-progress-top-priorities-to-2030/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Brookings Report Reflects on Africa’s SDG Progress, Top Priorities to 2030","The Brookings Institution released a report that assesses the top priorities for Africa between now and 2030, including areas where it should urgently make progress towards specific SDG targets. The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

29,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/guide-applies-sdg-monitoring-and-evaluation-to-national-contexts/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Guide Applies SDG Monitoring and Evaluation to National Contexts,"The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the EVALSDGs network, Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have released a guide to designing SDG evaluation frameworks around existing national contexts. The authors apply their proposed process to the national contexts of Costa Rica, Finland, and Nigeria to illustrate ways to incorporate SDG evaluation throughout the policy planning cycle.

Launched in New York, US on 4 February 2020, the guide titled, ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs,’ argues that a “one-size-fits-all manual” cannot be successful in evaluating success on the SDGs at the national level. The publication reports that a common thread from input provided by 33 government representatives and evaluation specialists from 22 countries is that, if evaluation is to assist in aligning national policy with the 2030 Agenda, it must be bespoke, built around existing political and assessment systems.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The guide thus outlines four steps of evaluation development and design. They include:

Identify the overall objective and use of the evaluation, by consulting and engaging with different stakeholder groups (e.g. civil society organizations, parliamentarians);

Prepare for the evaluation by designing participatory processes, defining the scope and focus of the evaluation, and identifying the policies and plans to be evaluated;

Use 2030 Agenda principles (e.g. universality, equity, leave no one behind) to inform the evaluative criteria, and use the principles to develop the evaluation questions; and

Frame the evaluation according to the logic of national policies, develop and cost a communication plan.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing.

The guide offers indicative questions, suggested criteria and decision trees to help practitioners develop robust SDG evaluation plans tailored to their national contexts. Lessons from case studies in Costa Rica, Finland and Nigeria are applied to each of the above steps, demonstrating how the SDG evaluation can be integrated throughout the policy cycle.

The guide also highlights the ways in which SDG monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes and results can support national progress on sustainable development, and be integrated into national M&E systems. Early national experiences show that governments can use evaluative tools in: identifying issues that affect sustainable development trajectories and for formulating and adopting policies around those issues; establishing responsibilities to coordinate actions and allocate resources during policy implementation; and assessing the policies’ worth in the context of the SDGs and national priorities, to support optimal outcomes in line with key principles.

The guide also highlights methodological considerations to take into account when developing an SDG evaluation. Attributes of sustainable development evaluation include: robust stakeholder engagement—which should occur throughout the four steps—and co-generation of recommendations; mixed approaches to gathering evidence, including both quantitative and qualitative sources; integrative analysis, which reviews policies or programs from economic, social and environmental perspectives; assessing sustainable development interventions in current their spatial, temporal, socioeconomic and environmental contexts; and recognizing both upstream drivers and downstream effects, as well as impacts beyond national boundaries and across borders.

Acknowledging that there is no single way to monitor and evaluate progress against the Goals, and flagging disparities between countries in terms of their evaluation infrastructure and readiness, the authors emphasize that SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The SDGs are not meant to impose an additional layer of policies on top of current ones, but rather to serve as “a compass for aligning countries’ plans with their global commitments.”

The guide also outlines how SDG evaluation can inform countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) presented during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The publication was inspired by a workshop on ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs’, which convened in Helsinki, Finland, in March 2019 to foster cross-country learning and understanding on common challenges.

30,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/suriname-norway-submit-2020-ndcs/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Suriname, Norway Submit 2020 NDCs","Suriname and Norway have submitted their 2020 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The two countries follow Marshall Islands, which in 2018 became the first country to submit its second NDC.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change establishes five-year cycles to increase ambition, including through NDCs that would grow more ambitious over time. Countries requested that in 2020, Parties with an NDC time frame up to 2025 communicate new NDCs, and Parties with a time frame up to 2030 communicate or update their NDCs by 2020.

Suriname submitted its second NDC on 9 December 2019. As low-lying coastal country and, like Marshall Islands, a small island developing State (SIDS), Suriname and its population face vulnerability as economic activities are concentrated in the coastal zone. Therefore, Suriname’s NDC includes adaptation elements, including its 2019 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as part of its climate strategy.

Among its conditional and unconditional mitigation contributions, Suriname’s NDC presents a package of policies and measures with sectoral sub-targets, including enhanced contributions from four of the country’s six emitting sectors: forests, electricity, agriculture, and transport, which together cover an estimated 70% of emissions.

In its NDC submission, Suriname emphasizes its efforts to protect its natural resource and forests serving the global community as a biodiversity hotspot and a carbon sink. As a high forest cover and low deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname commits to maintaining 93% forest cover.

Forty-one countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

Taking into account Suriname’s domestic circumstances and capabilities, the maintenance of the carbon stock and the sectoral emission reductions are undertaken on the basis of equity, conditional on the availability of finance, and in the context of sustainable development, according to the NDC document.

Norway submitted its updated NDC on 7 February 2020, with a target to achieve economy-wide emission reductions of “at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels” for the time frame 2021-2030. The target covers all sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs). This is an ambition enhancement from the country’s original NDC, in which Norway intended a 40% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Norway seeks to fulfill the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

In the event Norway’s enhanced NDC should go beyond the target set in the EU’s updated NDC, Norway intends to use voluntary cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 to fulfill the part that goes beyond what is fulfilled through the climate cooperation with the EU. Norway notes that the EU’s current climate framework “does not open for the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs) from outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA), emphasizing that final accounting towards its NDC target may depend on any further arrangements in Norway’s cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

Norway further informs that it will have specific legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering emissions from all sectors and all GHGs. About half of Norwegian GHG emissions are covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which regulates emissions from industrial plants, power plants, the petroleum industry, and commercial aviation within the EEA. Not covered by the EU ETS are emissions from industry, petroleum, and the transport, agriculture, buildings, and waste management sectors. These are regulated under the Effort Sharing Regulations, which set binding national targets. Norway’s national target is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS-sectors by 40% in 2030 compared to 2005. The target can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by the use of flexible mechanisms within the EU framework. With regard to the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation, Norway’s commitment is to ensure that emissions do not exceed removals in this sector.

Norway considers the NDC “fair and ambitious” as it is in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 and onwards that correspond to keeping global warming in line with the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2°C,” and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, above preindustrial levels. Norway references the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Panel’s special report revealing pathways towards limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

Since the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in 2016, a number of world leaders, including during the 2019 UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, said they would submit new or updated NDCs by the first quarter of 2020. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), with partners, issued a supporting guidance for this process of developing new or updated NDCs, which it generally treats as “NDC enhancement.” According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 2020 NDC tracker, 41 countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) informed governments that a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.

Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:

Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).
Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.
To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway.
Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs.

Governments have increased efforts to decouple their economies from resource use, but the demand for extractive resources is projected to continue to grow, especially in emerging economies.

As a basis for the proposed SDLO framework, the report titled, ‘Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing Extractive Industries Towards Sustainable Development,’ maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives that focus on delivering the SDGs. The authors lament, however, that the existing frameworks do not operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

Noting that extractive industries can cause extensive and lasting damage, the report critiques the current paradigm of “social license to operate” (SLO), which it notes arose as a response to business risk. The SLO paradigm aims to accommodate community demands to the minimum extent necessary to avoid public opposition and social conflict, and associated reputational damage, the authors write.

To move beyond SLO and consolidate existing instruments, the report sets out consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the SDGs and other international policy commitments. It identifies eight SDGs in which the extractive sector, if well-managed, can play a positive role: Goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Effective mineral resource governance incorporates human rights, responsible business practices, greater engagement of home countries, and economic decoupling.

UNEP emphasizes that the minerals and metals industry can promote social cohesion, inclusiveness and economic progress among low-income countries and vulnerable populations, but guidance is needed. The report elaborates that the SDLO model advocates for fairer deals, equal share of benefits among stakeholders and holistic consideration of regulations that are not inclusive on their own.

The proposed SDLO framework addresses large-scale mining and investigates artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), in which some marginalized groups in certain geographies partake, though often without oversight by policymakers. The framework does so in part by extending responsibility to ensure implementation is shared by both “host” and “home” countries, and by expanding the scope to a broader swath of the extractive value chain. However, the authors caution that the SDLO is not a substitute for laws and regulations, and that extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water.

Prerequisites of an effective mineral resource governance framework, the report notes, include decoupling economic growth from environmental and social impacts, protecting human rights, establishing responsible business practices, and ensuring greater engagement of home countries. With respect to national and sub-national governance, the report recommends that countries establish three public institutions: an environment directorate, a mining directorate and a geological survey to regulate the mines and metals industries. The report also articulates the role and responsibility of host governments, which includes devising responsible concession agreements, mainstreaming environmental assessment, domesticating natural capital accounting, ensuring transparency and channeling extractive rents into public investment.

Internationally, the report advocates for the creation of an International Minerals Agency to improve coordination mechanisms, or at least settling on an international agreement to share data on economic geology, mineral demand and the industry’s impacts. It suggests that this agreement could be negotiated through existing for a such as the UN Environment Assembly, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, and wider ongoing UN processes focused on reviewing progress towards the SDGs.

In December 2019 and January 2020, we saw this in discussions and reports on adaptation finance. They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows. Discussions also focused on the need for current business models to adapt to increasing climate risks and transform production processes to halt nature loss.

Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about the level of progress made. On the one hand, they saw missed opportunities such as to determine how cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement on climate change should advance. On the other, they noted steady achievements in the work of scientific bodies. In January, lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II (WG II) continued to advance work on the Group’s contribution to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6), focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, due for release in October 2021.

Seen in the light of adaptation funding activities, identified impacts and needs, these recent discussions suggest that climate change adaptation requires a rethinking of production, redistribution and equity. This Policy Brief focuses on these and other recent developments that inform climate adaptation finance.

UNFCCC Reflects on Its Integration of Adaptation, Prepares for 2023 Global Stocktake

The Adaptation Committee, established in 2010 under the UNFCCC, issued a report reflecting on the evolution of adaptation in the climate regime and outlining its work towards the first global stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement scheduled in 2023. Titled, ‘25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC,’ the report was released at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December 2019. Citing findings from the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report draws attention to increasingly more urgent adaptation needs.

The report notes that rising adaptation costs are likely to range from USD 140 billion to 300 billion per annum by 2030, and could rise to between USD 280 billion and 500 billion per annum by 2050. The Committee highlights the specific roles of the Convention’s Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism to support adaptation. Reporting on its own activities, the Committee informs of its partnerships with international, regional and national stakeholders and its efforts on engaging the private sector. A strategy for private sector engagement was also discussed at the 57th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council in December.

Looking forward, the Adaptation Committee notes that the seventh review of the GEF, the oldest operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, will be initiated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC will also start key negotiations on the post-2025 finance goal. Over the course of 2020, developed countries are expected to make submissions on finance beyond 2020 and on the alignment of global finance with the Paris goals.

The Committee further outlines its work towards the 2023 global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assessment of collective progress towards achieving its long-term goals. The global stocktake will conduct a review of overall progress made towards achieving the global goal on adaptation and the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation action and support. Inputs for the stocktake will include reports from the “network of institutions” established to enhance adaptation actions.

COP 25 Agrees of Arrangements for Adaptation Fund Going Forward, But Further Work Remains

The Adaption Fund approved a record USD 188 million in new projects in 2019, and reached the milestone of 100 concrete adaptation projects financed in vulnerable developing countries. The Fund fosters country ownership and enables direct access to adaptation finance for applicants from accredited national implementing entities from developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. It provides new learning opportunities, such as e-learning programmes to enhance access to climate finance, and new grants that foster adaptation practices on the ground and scale up effective projects.

Given its important role and the benefits it creates for an increasing number of countries in need of adaptation finance, the Fund welcomed two decisions taken during the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December, on decreasing risks of interruptions in the Fund’s work. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted:

amendments to the Fund’s arrangements with the World Bank to provide services as its interim trustee, to now be an open-ended arrangement; and

a decision that there will be no end date attached to its memorandum of understanding with the GEF Council on the GEF hosting the Fund’s secretariat.

However, the fact that COP 25 failed to conclude negotiations on the modalities of cooperative approaches under Paris Agreement Article 6 left some open questions.

In line with previous decisions, the Fund has served the Paris Agreement since January 2019. It will no longer serve the Kyoto Protocol once the share of proceeds becomes available under the sustainable development mechanism of Agreement Article 6.4, though it will continue to receive the share of proceeds, if available, from activities under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

The failure to conclude negotiations at COP 25 leaves unclear precisely how much of the share of proceeds under Agreement Article 6.4 sustainable development mechanism will become available for the Adaptation Fund. There seems to be consensus on a minimum share of 2% but possible increases are still under discussion. Parties further disagreed, among others, on whether a share of proceeds would also come from both market-based approaches, namely transactions under the mechanism, as well as from the trading of Article 6.2 “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs). Many countries called for equal treatment of rules for both approaches, for a number of reasons. In the context of adaptation finance, developing countries highlighted the value of predictable funding. As reported by some analysts, many of the countries likely to be on the buying end, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Norway, are concerned about higher costs of their carbon offsets.

COP 25 also did not result in any decision on whether the membership representation of developing and developed countries on the Adaptation Fund Board should change, given its role in serving the Paris Agreement.

Tracking Adaptation Finance

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has set out to tackle significant data and reporting challenges to capturing global adaptation finance flows. Adaptation investment, the Initiative finds, is difficult to track due to challenges associated with context dependency, the uncertain causality of investments made, a lack of impact metrics, and confidentiality and reporting requirements.

For this reason, CPI’s report titled, ‘ Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019,’ does not track any private sector adaptation finance. The Initiative underlines that almost all adaptation finance covered in the report was funded by public actors and that the tracking of public domestic adaptation finance remains limited. Nevertheless, that report finds that adaptation finance gained momentum in 2017-2018, increasing 35% to an annual average of USD 30 billion from 2015-2016, although adaptation still accounts for just 5% of tracked climate finance based on available data.

In its subsequent December report titled, ‘Tracking Adaptation Finance: Advancing Methods to Capture Finance Flows in the Landscape,’ CPI briefs on potential methods to fill data gaps for the tracking of adaptation finance flows, and proposes methods to measure progress.

The proposed framework, the authors suggest, can serve to identify information that should be tracked and reported by local governments and companies. The aim is to improve the understanding, and, ultimately, delivery, of adaptation finance. CPI finds that:

Investment flows that are specific to adaptation and resilience must be understood in the context of the total investment that receives a resilience benefit from the incremental adaptation investment;

Adaptation- and resilience-focused flows should be measured against total investment by sector to understand progress made to achieve resilience against a benchmark; and

Technical approaches, such as keyword searches and investment matching against national adaptation goals and geographic climate risk, can help identify adaptation flows in datasets that do not label them as such.

World Economic Forum Recognizes Climate and “Nature-based” Risks

The World Economic Forum (WEF), which convened for its 50th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from 21-24 January 2020, issued its annual Global Risks Report 2020. Based on its Global Risks Perception Survey results, the Forum concurs with findings from other fora that climate change is the stand-out long-term risk the world faces. It stresses that the near-term consequences of climate change amount to a “planetary emergency” with catastrophic, wide-ranging and intersecting implications. The WEF report also ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years.

As a traditionally business-centric gathering, the WEF finds that USD 44 trillion of economic value generation is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Illustrating how nature loss impacts businesses’ operations, supply chains and markets, the Forum urges the business community to adapt to several nature-based risks and implications. These risks, explained in another WEF report titled, ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ can be assessed using climate risk categories as defined in the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Under its ‘Nature Action Agenda’ stakeholder platform, the Forum has identified areas where strategic transformation of current business models and production processes can contribute the most to halting and reversing nature loss, and ways to finance this transformation.

Climate Change Adaptation Requires Rethinking of Production, Redistribution and Equity

Reflecting on these discussions, one cannot ignore the diversity of stakeholder groups engaged in addressing climate change impacts and their growing need of global adaptation finance. That need is estimated at USD 180 billion annually from 2020-2030 and USD 50 billion annually from many developing countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. While the UNFCCC and its constituent bodies prepare for upcoming procedural tasks, and the IPCC is advancing work towards AR6 publication, others talk about business opportunities and revenues. Few can envision the estimated sums in question. Half of the world’s biggest companies say “climate adaptation solutions could result in USD 236 billion in increased revenue.” Some suggest that “in the food and land-use sector alone, the climate challenge provides an annual business opportunity of USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2030.” At the same time, those that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including African farmers and island nations, speak of securing their livelihoods and coping with the negative impacts of climate change while lacking the means to adapt.

One of the notions underpinning these contrasting discussions is equity, with its different meanings and undertones. In an effort to to answer the basic economic questions of production and distribution, which all societies grapple with, we could think of what products are going to be made and by what means. How are the claims on production and incomes divided among resource contributors? How is production divided between private and public purposes? And more pertinently perhaps, given the limited ecological capacity within which the established global economy has to function, how is production divided between the present and the future?","They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows.

It also reports on a set of “common internationalized resource identifiers” for the SDGs and their targets and indicators.

The report of the Secretary-General titled, ‘Work for the review of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,’ was submitted ahead of the UN Statistical Commission’s 51st session in March 2020.

On the federated information system for the SDGs, the report notes that it was launched in March 2017 as a research exercise on strengthening the ability of the national and global statistical systems to manage and share knowledge, information and good practices on data and statistics for the SDGs. Following its 2017 endorsement at the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management (GGIM), the system has been providing access to national data shared by participating countries, as well as geospatially-enabled statistical data on SDG indicators.

Most recently, the UN Statistics Division and technology partners have worked to scale up the federated system initiative to include new countries and build capacity at the national level. The federated system is also being used to support the UN Development Coordination Office in displaying country data and visualizing country progress towards the SDGs. This could include online country profiles to visualize geospatially-enabled statistical data from the Global SDG Indicators Database.

The report invites the Statistical Commission to express its views on the scaling-up of the federated information system of national and global data hubs.

All UN organizations and stakeholders have been urged to tag their SDG-related resources according to the common identifiers.

The Secretary-General also reports on the common internationalized resource identifiers for Goals, targets, indicators and related statistical series. The identifiers were developed by the High-level Committee on Management of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), the UN Statistics Division and the UN Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM). They are now hosted by the UN’s Dag Hammarskjöld Library.

The common identifiers are intended to help create a “homogeneously classified information space” and allow for automatic retrieval, processing and integration of information related to the Goals on the semantic web. In November 2019, the Secretary-General presented the common identifiers to the CEB, inviting all UN organizations to adopt the identifiers by signing the related statement of adoption. To date, the statement has been signed by eight organizations.

A pilot application was developed by the UN Statistics Division and the Division for the SDGs (both part of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, DESA), with EU support. The application, currently in “demo form,” automatically extracts key concepts related to sustainable development from text documents and links them to the most relevant SDGs, targets, indicators and series. In other words, it finds semantic links between text, statistical data, and SDG entities.”

The report invites the Statistical Commission to take note of the identifiers and express its views on their potential use for the dissemination of statistical data sets in linked-open-data formats.

The report also provides an update on the Data for Now initiative, launched in September 2019 and jointly led by the UN Statistics Division, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, the World Bank and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Data for Now works to build capacity in countries to utilize new data sources.

A technical workshop took place in November 2019, in Kigali, Rwanda, resulting in country-specific road maps for data related to education, human mobility, poverty and land use. The partnerships initiated during the workshop are expected to be “consolidated and expanded over the next year,” with results to be showcased at the UN World Data Forum in October 2020, according to the Secretary-General’s report.

The report invites the Statistical Commission to endorse the Data for Now initiative.

The Commission will hold its 51st session from 3-6 March 2020. The session also will consider 36 proposed “major changes” to the SDG indicator framework, resulting from the 2020 Comprehensive Review of the indicators conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

Each year starts with the possibility of a new beginning, but often still carries the baggage of the previous year. As 2020 begins, the international community faces deadlines to replace old frameworks and rules with new ones, and to conclude negotiations on new treaties and agreements.

It is timely to take stock of global environmental governance as the world enters a new year and a new decade. In our new report, ‘The State of Global Environmental Governance 2019,’ the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team reflects on the successes, shortcomings and overall trends of 2019. We also look ahead, with optimism 2020 will regain the momentum recently lost.

In 2019, scientists were truth-tellers. Over the course of the year, international scientific bodies produced a range of reports on climate change, biodiversity, and the environment as a whole. Each report contains dire warnings for the future of the planet due to the impact of climate change on food production, of pollution on human health, and land incursions on species extinctions. Given historic inaction, nearly every system on the planet is in danger.

Yet, despite the thousands of pages of scientific evidence, intergovernmental political processes remain deadlocked on so many issues. Policy makers could not mount the type of response commensurate with the science.

Climate change governance had a particularly difficult year, limping to the end of the decade after the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The demands for climate ambition are loud, and angry. Millions of children and youth, feeling their futures have been stolen, participated in climate strikes every Friday throughout the year. Hearing their calls, 67 countries pledged greater climate ambition at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September, but these countries represent only a small fraction of global emissions. As the year came to a close, governments at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP 25) failed to issue a clear call for ambition and could not agree on rules for the market mechanism necessary to complete the Paris Agreement rulebook. The Paris Agreement officially begins in 2020 amid major questions about its ability to catalyze climate ambition and prevent global warming above 2°C.

There were a few bright spots during the year as some policymakers acted on the scientific truths. The first multilateral action to reduce global plastic waste, which amounts to millions of tons each year, was taken under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Certain Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In May, parties to the Basel Convention agreed to include mixed, unrecyclable, and contaminated plastic waste exports into the control regime that requires the consent of importing countries before waste exports can proceed. The fourth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly sent a strong signal that production and consumption of single-use plastics should be reduced or phased out, and the plastics industry has been put on notice. In fact, over the course of the year more than 30 countries around the world, nearly half of which are in Africa, put in place bans on single-use plastic bags.

As we outline in a chapter on linkages, 2019 was also notable for increasing recognition of the need for a more interconnected form of governance. More and more, actors drew linkages among environmental and sustainable development processes, especially biodiversity and climate change, land and climate change, oceans and climate change, human health and the environment, and economics, trade and climate change. The increased understanding about the impacts of degrading ecosystems and a warming climate on local and global economies alike, has led to a number of multinational companies and financial institutions announcing new climate-friendly policies and investments.

Of course, the links among the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are many and complementary. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report was released in time for the SDG Summit in September. The report outlined progress in some critical areas, including declines in extreme poverty and the under-5 mortality rate, increases in access to electricity, and greater efforts to respond to urbanization, waste, and illegal fishing. Nonetheless, many areas need urgent collective attention, including climate change, ocean acidification, land degradation, hunger, education and gender equality. The report also stressed that the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is jeopardized as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts, and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

It is abundantly clear the world needs an urgent, ambitious response to unleash a social and economic transformation. But, in 2019, world leaders appeared detached from the crisis at hand, reading statements that were largely devoid of meaningful pledges. This reaction was in stark contrast to the verdict of the people who rose in protest during the Summit and throughout the year: leaders are failing to address the environmental and development emergency the world faces.

This year, we face a busy international agenda as well as waning political will, rising nationalism, and faltering support for multilateralism. 2020 is expected to conclude negotiations and establish new tools to address biodiversity, marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and a post-2020 strategic approach to international chemicals management. We are already in the fifth year of SDG implementation, and to succeed by their 2030 completion date, governments still need to increase their ambition under the Paris Agreement.

Positive, forward-looking outcomes are essential, but not guaranteed.

The XIV Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Santiago, Chile from 27-31 January 2020, ahead of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), and its Beijing Platform for Action. This year’s CSW session will conduct a review of progress towards the action platform.

The Regional Conference served to review progress towards the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, adopted in 2016 at the XIII Regional Conference, and identify barriers to progress.

Without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.

During the Conference, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) launched a regional progress report that identifies hurdles to achieving gender equality in the region. The Regional Progress Report on the Montevideo Strategy, the first of its kind, recognizes successes towards achieving gender equality in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region to date. It also finds that as LAC governments prepare for Beijing+25, challenges include 1) the sheer magnitude of gender inequalities in the region and the limited State capacities available to address the issue; 2) lack of disaggregated data to analyze the issue; 3) the fact that gender inequalities manifest themselves at international, regional, national and subnational levels, and coordination is needed to renew and implement public policy across governance levels; and 4) the need to increase the budgets allotted to gender equality policies.

The Conference concluded with countries’ approval of the Santiago Commitment. The Commitment’s 48 points outline the means by which countries will accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. It welcomes the Regional Progress Report and reaffirms the commitments made in Beijing in 1995. The Commitment encourages countries to foster and promote public polices on various dimensions of gender equality including education, representation, labor participation, to measure the multiplier effects of boosting the care economy and strengthen the production of gender statistics at the national level, and to voluntarily report on progress.

At the Regional Conference’s closing session, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said it is time to “put an end to patriarchy as a societal model.” Isabel Plá, Chile’s Minister of Women’s Affairs and Gender Equity, emphasized that “without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.” The next session of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean is planned to be held in Argentina, in 2022.

Other regions have also affirmed commitments ahead of Beijing+25. UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab Regions committed to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at meetings organized in November 2019 by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), which resulted in respective declarations on progress.

In Europe, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) held a review meeting from 29-30 October 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland, co-hosted with the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia. In Africa, a regional review took place from 27 October to 1 November 2019, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UN Women and the African Union Commission (AUC). SDG Knowledge Hub coverage on the European and African meetings is available here.","Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean approved a commitment to 48 ways of accelerating implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Regional Gender Agenda.

The report argues that, beyond the compliance agenda, cities and regions should leverage the full potential of SDGs as a policy tool to improve people’s lives in a shared responsibility across levels of government.

The experiences of nine pilot cities and regions show the SDGs’ potential to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

Released during the Tenth World Urban Forum (WUF), on 10 February 2020, the report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs: Synthesis Report,’ highlights the key role of subnational governments in achieving the SDGs and demonstrates the importance of the SDGs for cities and regions. The report argues that many OECD countries are increasingly seizing the potential of the SDGs as a framework to improve multi-level governance, and in particular vertical coordination. For instance, Germany and Japan are promoting the “localisation” of the SDGs from the central government level by supporting cities and regions in their local SDGs strategies, both financially and in terms of capacity building. The report also documents – from the experience and evidence of nine pilot cities and regions – the potential that the SDGs offer to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

The report introduces a ‘Checklist for Public Action’ to help policymakers implement a territorial approach to the SDGs. The checklist presents action-oriented recommendations across five categories: planning, policies and strategies; multi-level governance; financing and budgeting; data and information; and engagement.

On planning, policies, and strategies, the checklist recommends defining and shaping local and regional development visions, strategies and plans and reorienting existing ones using the SDGs as a guiding framework; using the SDGs to manage tradeoffs and promote synergies among sectoral policies and across levels of government and link social, economic and environmental dimensions at the Goal or target level; using the SDGs to address concrete local challenges that require holistic approaches, such as access to green spaces, territorial inequalities or service delivery; and identifying place-based priorities through a participatory, multi-stakeholder process that considers the indivisibility and interconnectedness of the SDGs.

On engagement, the checklist suggests: using the SDGs as a vehicle to enhance accountability and transparency through engaging all territorial stakeholders in the policymaking process, including co-designing and co-implementing visions and strategies in a bottom-up, participatory way; engaging stakeholders using a combination of tools, such as providing networking opportunities, de-risking investments in SDG solutions through grants or loans; and using the SDGs as a tool for “public service motivation” by linking staff’s daily work with SDG achievement. Selected examples illustrate how cities and regions have implemented these recommendations.

The OECD Localised Indicator Framework for the SDGs measures the distance towards the SDGs for 601 regions and 649 cities, using 135 indicators across the 17 SDGs. At least 80% of regions from OECD countries have not achieved the suggested end values for 2030 in any of the 17 Goals. The average distance of OECD regions to the SDGs in 2030 ranges from 25% to 60%, showing that cities and regions in OECD countries are “far from achieving the SDGs.” Cities and regions are lagging behind the most on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action), and are performing the best on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Cities and regions can use the tool to compare their performance with other cities and regions in their country and identify peers in other countries. The tool aims to promote peer-learning and policy dialogues across cities and regions, increase government accountability on the SDGs, and raise awareness on the SDGs among society as a whole. An overview of Tataouine, Tunisia, for example shows that the city is 50% of the way towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), below the OECD average of 69%, and 48% percent of the way towards reaching SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), below the OECD average of 73%. The tool identifies Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand as a comparable city or region. The tool identifies Kinki, Japan, and Oslo and Akershus, Norway, as peer regions for New York, US.

OECD’s Programme on a Territorial Approach to the SDGs produced the report and indicator framework. The Programme plans to publish nine additional pilot-specific reports. Each report will offer in-depth analysis, tailored policy recommendations and action plans to champion a territorial approach to the SDGs.

OECD will launch a second phase of the Programme, which will work to implement recommendations and to support new cities, regions and countries in their efforts to localize the SDGs.

The declaration was named for the COP’s host city in India.

In addition to the Declaration’s call, a High-Level Segment also contributed outcomes for integration in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected to be adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference, in October, in Kunming, China. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Acting Executive Secretary, informed COP 13 participants that the post-2020 biodiversity framework will be simple and transformative, but unlikely to include targets other than those already in the Aichi Targets.

Towards this end, the High-Level Segment discussed priorities for migratory species conservation in the framework, with speakers highlighting that this was the first CMS COP since the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) sounded the alarm that a million species, including many migratory species, might be lost in the coming decade. Ministers and other high-level participants emphasized the need to mainstream biodiversity across all sectors, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches. They also called for including migratory species considerations in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions on climate change.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices. Seven were added to Appendix I, which comprises migratory species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The seven species added to Appendix I included the Asian elephant, jaguar, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, little bustard, antipodean albatross and the oceanic white-tip shark.

The Urial sheep, smooth hammerhead shark, and the tope shark were listed for protection under Appendix II, which covers migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status and that require international cooperation for their conservation and management. In addition, new and extended Concerted Actions with targeted conservation plans were approved for 14 species.

The Earth Negotiation Bulletin report from COP13 also indicates that Parties also agreed on the following measures benefiting migratory species:

integrate biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy;

strengthen initiatives to combat the illegal killing, taking, and trade of migratory birds;

mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species;

deepen the understanding of the importance of animal culture and social complexity for the conservation of endangered species; and

investigate possible trade in CMS Appendix I species and the implications for their conservation status.

CMS COP13 and the associated meetings of the Standing Committee met from 15-22 February 2020. It brought together 2,550 people, including 263 delegates representing 82 parties, 11 delegates from five non-party countries, 50 representatives from UN agencies, 70 representatives of international non-governmental organizations, 127 representatives of national non-governmental organizations, and over 100 members of both national and international media.

40,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/un-sustainable-development-goals-good-governance-sdg-mena-news-17612/,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Fair Observer,The Importance of Good Governance,"To the extent that people know anything about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they reasonably assume that they have something to do with the economy (development), and with the environment (sustainability). They’re only partly right. The bigger challenge, especially for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, is governance.

The 17 SDGs were adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, with a target date of 2030. That leaves 10 years to achieve, amongst others: no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, affordable and clean energy and climate action. These are major challenges for all governments, not just MENA.

Yet the most challenging of the goals may be the one that hardly gets talked about: SDG 16. It calls for governments to “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

It’s Complicated

All the SDGs are accompanied by specific targets. The ones for SDG 16 include: promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all; substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels; ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels; and ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

This is a familiar list of ingredients of “good governance” as it has been defined by major international agencies like the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development over the last 20 years. But they are more than a list: They are mutually reinforcing. It’s hard to achieve one without the others.

Take eradicating bribery and corruption. How could that be achieved if the courts are in the back pockets of political and business leaders? Corruption cannot be truly addressed without the rule of law. But real rule of law needs accountability and transparency, which means public access to information and protection of fundamental freedoms.

I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. You can review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for further information.

It gets more complicated. The target of “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels” is a target less about governments than about civil society and non-governmental institutions. SDG 16 is not just about the institutions of government — it is about the relationship of government to society as well.

It gets more complicated still. In addition to accountability, transparency and participation, SDG 16 also has a target of “effective” institutions at all levels. It is not clear what that means in the context of SDG 16, but it must have something to do with the results and targets for the other SDGs. For example, SDG 4, on quality education and its target of (to take just one) “equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university,” would require both massive investments and well-designed institutions.

Achieving most of the other SDGs will also depend on effective government institutions. For example, decent work and economic growth (SDG 8); innovation, industry and infrastructure (SDG 9); and climate action (SDG 13).

The SDGs, in short, are goals that can only be achieved through good and effective governance. SDG 16 makes that explicit, but it is embedded in most the other SDGs and their targets. This challenge of good governance is not just about warm and fuzzy slogans; it is about institutional design, about government capacity and about government-society relations.

Mixed Results

What progress has been made, and what are the pathways to success by 2030? For the MENA region, given the variety of situations and the intensity of conflict in many countries, the results are mixed. The “Sustainable Development Report 2019,” published by the UN-affiliated Sustainable Development Solutions Network, notes that “Conflicts in some countries lead to poor and declining performance on most of the SDGs and in particular on SDG 2 (No Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).”

While access to clean water, sanitation and clean energy is generally high, the report calls for more efforts to deal with high levels of perceived corruption. It is cold comfort that Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa fare even worse on most SGDs in general, and SDG 16 especially.

The path forward on governance, for all countries and not just MENA, is not to try to do everything all at once. The year 2030 is only a decade away. If we think of the SDGs as 17 rail cars, what are the engines that will pull them into the station on time?

First, education. The results of a good educational system are educated citizens, who will in turn contribute to economic growth and to civil society development. Second, anti-corruption and rule of law. The lessons of recent uprisings and protests around the world are clear: Nothing ignites public outrage more than the injustice that comes with the rot of corruption. Third, build capacity in public institutions through training and high standards of competence and merit. The 2030 Agenda is only a decade away. Achieving SDG 16 is the key to success. We need to start now.

The MCO and regional reviews are part of the repositioning process for the UN development system.

Mohammed is providing a series of briefings as well as written updates ahead of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities for Development segment (OAS), which will convene in May 2020.

In the briefing at UN Headquarters on 29 January 2020, Mohammed said the regions have been “the ‘forgotten level,’ largely left untouched in previous reform efforts.” But regional assets are critical to achieve the 2030 Agenda because of the cross-border nature of today’s greatest challenges, including climate, trade, health and conflict, she said.

Mohammed reported on progress that has “significantly raised the bar” for the regional level, including:

Establishing inter-agency teams in each region, with a focus on “unpacking the five broad transformative areas” outlined in the Secretary-General’s 2019 report to ECOSOC;

Detailing the architecture of proposed regional collaboration platforms (RCPs);

Establishing a knowledge hub in each region, with the Arab region’s ‘Manara’ being the most advanced; and

Enhancing transparency at the regional level.

Mohammed said that beginning in 2021, ECOSOC will receive aggregated information on regional collaboration, a type of reporting that “does not currently exist and addresses a major gap in accountability.”

On data and statistics, regional ‘SDG Gateways’ are being established for pooling SDG data for consistent analysis and action. The first SDG Gateways will launch in March 2020 in three regions: Arab States, the Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

In late February 2020, discussions will begin with each region on their specific initiatives. The review will be finalized by late March, she said, and she will discuss work plans and transitions in her visits to each region during its upcoming SDG Forum (Regional Forum for Sustainable Development).

On the MCO review, Mohammed explained that these are offices that cover mostly small islands, which to date have had limited attention to each country’s specificities. After visiting 15 countries in 2019, the Secretariat presented recommendations for improving the UN development system’s support in MCO settings. Subsequently, an inter-agency working group and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) facilitated more specific consultations on putting each proposal into practice.

Mohammed said UN development system entities have made specific commitments including increased financing, data systems, physical presences, technical capacities, and policy advice. In addition, coordination capacities have been provided with greater resources. As a result of this process, seven countries that are serviced by the Caribbean MCO but do not have an office in country will now have a coordination office; and a road map has been created to establish a North Pacific office.

She said OHRLLS continues to hold dialogues with all countries concerned to address remaining questions on substance and process. Resident Coordinators are ensuring that “national counterparts are fully in the loop” and “there will be no implementation before the ECOSOC has the opportunity to consider all proposals” at the OAS session.

The OAS will convene from 19-21 May 2020, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The segment will review four years of implementation of the UNGA guidance contained in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of UN system operational activities for development (QCPR), as well as progress in the repositioning of the UN development system as mandated in UNGA resolution 72/279.

The UNGA will conduct its next QCPR in late 2020. The UN Secretary-General’s report to the ECOSOC operational activities segment is also the main Secretariat input to the UNGA for its QCPR deliberations. ECOSOC’s webpage on the QCPR notes that the 2020 QCPR is “expected to build on the outcomes of the 2019 SDG Summit, thus placing an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.” In addition, it notes that the UNGA will discuss the QCPR “on the heels” of the high-level event commemorating the UN’s 75th anniversary, which could position it to “give new impetus and high-level political guidance to the UN development system repositioning and its efforts to work in an effective and impactful way across peace, development, humanitarian affairs and human rights.” [UN Deputy Secretary-General’s remarks] [ECOSOC website on OAS]","UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed informed UN Member States of steps taken to strengthen the UN development system’s regional level, and its multi-country offices (MCOs) in the Caribbean and Pacific, among other updates.

43,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/making-finance-flows-consistent-with-the-paris-agreement/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Making Finance Flows Consistent with the Paris Agreement,"Recent discussions and reports assessing the effectiveness of climate finance flows to meet an increasing global need reveal a growing momentum for aligning such flows with the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In this context, the Policy Brief also discusses the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) decision to end funding fossil fuel energy projects.

EIB Ends Funding of Fossil Fuel Energy Projects

In November 2019, the EIB Board adopted a decision to end financing for fossil fuel energy projects by the end of 2021. In its energy lending policy, aimed at supporting the energy transformation, the Bank further laid out its climate action and environmental sustainability strategy and focus on support for clean energy and security.

Specifically, the policy change means that the Bank will phase out support to:

the production of oil and natural gas;

traditional gas infrastructure;

power generation technologies resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above 250 gCO2 per kWh of electricity generated; and

large-scale heat production infrastructure based on unabated oil, natural gas, coal or peat.

The Bank will potentially continue to approve gas infrastructure projects already formally under appraisal until the end of 2021, noting that switching from oil or coal to natural gas may reduce GHG emissions in the short term.

The EIB explains that it will support clean energy and security directly by: reinforcing electricity networks; reducing energy demand through energy efficiency projects or through low-carbon power generation; and deploying demand response or storage at scale. According to the policy, five principles will govern future EIB engagement in the energy sector:

Prioritizing energy efficiency with a view to supporting the new EU target under the EU Energy Efficiency Directive; Enabling energy decarbonization through increased support for low- or zero-carbon technology, aiming to meet a 32% renewable energy share throughout the EU by 2030; Increasing financing for decentralized energy production, innovative energy storage and e-mobility; Ensuring grid investment for new, intermittent energy sources like wind and solar as well as strengthening cross-border interconnections; and Increasing the impact of investment to support energy transformation outside the EU.

Furthermore, the EIB Group stated that it expects its financing to unlock EUR 1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainable investment in the decade to 2030. The Bank will gradually increase the share of its financing dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability to reach 50% of its operations in 2025.

Outside the EU, the Bank foresees to support energy access with the development of energy systems that are low-carbon, efficient and reliable. The Bank’s energy lending volume represents only a small fraction of the required investment outside the EU. Looking to finance projects that reinforce countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Bank will support projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and energy transformation in other regions, in particular Asia and Latin America.

Aiming to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

Collectively, the EIB and the EU and its member States are the largest providers of public climate finance globally to developing countries, accounting for EUR 21.7 billion in 2018, including EUR 2.65 billion from the European Commission and EUR 2.97 billion from the EIB. The European Commission highlights this collective commitment, which kept increasing over the past five years, in the Fourth Biennial Report from the EU to the UNFCCC.

Like the EU, most developed country Parties have also submitted their biennial reports, as requested, by January 2020. These reports inform of Annex I Parties’: quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets; progress made towards their achievement, including information on mitigation actions and their effects, the estimates of emission reductions and removals, and the use of units from market-based mechanisms and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities; GHG emission trends and projections; and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing country Parties.

This information is relevant for the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal as well as adaptation and finance objectives, which are expressed in general terms in the Agreement’s provision articulating its purpose. On finance, Parties agreed to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” (Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c)).The EU’s BR4 stands out in this regard as it reports on EU’s implementation of this provision.

The European Commission explains its commitment to mainstream climate change mitigation and adaptation into all major EU spending programmes, with reference to the EIB’s Energy Lending Policy and the 2020 EU budget. With total commitments set at EUR 168.7 billion, the budget was endorsed in November 2019. To meet the goal of dedicating at least 20% of EU expenditure to climate protection in the period 2014-2020, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU agreed to increase the focus on climate-related actions in several areas. These include research and development, transport and energy infrastructure and the EU’s external action. Additional funds of EUR 590 million were allocated to the EU’s LIFE programme, the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and climate action, with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion for the 2014-2020 funding period. The European Commission also informs of its pledge to report on the “at least 25%” earmarking for the next financial framework 2021-2027.

The EU’s aim to make finance flows consistent with its climate commitments involves:

revenue spending from auctioning of EU ETS allowances;

diverting subsidies under the Renewable Energy Directive for transport sector from biofuel feedstocks with high indirect land use change emissions risks;

developing metrics and monitoring methodologies to track progress concerning finance flows; and

mobilizing the private sector through sustainable finance initiative and climate-related financial disclosure requirements.

Tracking Progress on the Paris Agreement’s Long-term Finance Goal

The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) is preparing the 2020 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. For this purpose, the Committee has called for submissions on evidence, including a list of needed information and data, with regard to:

methodological issues relating to measuring, reporting, and verifying climate finance flows;

data on climate-related finance flows;

assessment of the effectiveness of climate finance flows, including drivers, impact results, meeting needs, and access; and

information relevant to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c).

A call for improving understanding of finance flows was also heard during discussions at the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December 2019. Parties’ views, however, diverged on establishing a common definition of climate finance and on commencing work on the new collective post-2025 finance goal prior to the scheduled negotiations, to commence at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020.

At its 21st meeting in October 2019, the SCF addressed the determination of the needs of developing country Parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, which Parties had mandated the SCF to report on every four years, beginning in 2020. Prior to the meeting, the UNFCCC overhauled its Climate Finance Data Portal, which captures information, graphics and figures for a better understanding of climate finance flows, and informs of activities funded in developing countries to implement climate action, particularly financial flows that have been channeled, mobilized and leveraged by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It also presents information on Adaptation Fund project data related to entities, projects and programmes approved by the Adaptation Fund Board.

Defining Ways to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

According to the findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), momentum for aligning climate finance flows with the Paris Agreement is growing. Which multilateral development banks (MDBs) will follow in the EIB’s footsteps and take measures in support of the energy transformation? In its report titled, ‘Aligning Development Co-operation and Climate Action: The Only Way Forward,’ the OECD stressed that, in the case of “development finance,” support for energy efficiency and renewables has increased since the Paris Agreement, but continues to be undermined by financing for new fossil fuel-based energy. That means multilateral providers overall, which accounted for 77% of funding of fossil fuel activities in 2016 and 2017, need to change.

The complexity of “climate finance” is illustrated by data gaps, and heated negotiations characterized by diverging views on: what constitutes “new and additional” climate funding; whether climate finance should be excluded from being counted as official development assistance (ODA); and using private sector investments to meet climate finance needs.

Nevertheless, though drafted in general terms, the Paris Agreement provision on “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” reflects a certain degree of agreement among Parties. As the wording suggests, such efforts may entail whatever lies within state power, for example regulations, green fiscal policies, and providing public sustainable development aid to cause finance to flow in the direction of carbon neutrality. Yet given the time pressure to achieve the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, some have pointed to a growing realization that while necessary, globally, public finance alone may not be sufficient. While welcome, announcements such as by the EIB to double its share of sustainable financing to 50% are not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, making palpable the need for private sector investments at scale.

Private sector stakeholders, in turn, are certainly aware of their own climate change risks, including the issue of stranded assets, as noted in recent news. Companies are beginning to change their business models, expecting future revenues from demand for low-emission products and services. How this will influence climate finance flows, however, remains to be seen. Governments will have to identify their role in transforming economies and determine how to enable a shift in economic activities. In affluent societies, this may warrant considerations of basing these activities not only on the principle of “eco-efficiency,” which focuses on increasing output per unit of input, but also “eco-sufficiency,” which requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste and emissions in absolute terms.","This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The fund is accepting contributions from a range of partners to meet its $50 million target size, with the Nordic Development Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and the Government of Australia providing capital for the project’s preparation.



Operations are expected to begin in Q2 2020 with investment in early stage startups focused on addressing ESG issues such as climate change and the empowerment of women. ADB Ventures has a 17-year fund life, which means it can invest long-term capital into the projects selected.



Mike Barrow, director general for private sector operations, ADB, says: “This region is brimming with technology solutions to conserve energy, reduce waste, fight climate change, and deliver public services effectively.



“Our vision is for ADB Ventures to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to achieve the SDGs by 2030.”

Impact technology solutions refer to specially designed technologies which are fundamentally aimed at making a positive impact toward ESG factors.

Barrow continues: “ADB Ventures will help bring these solutions to market by leveraging our extensive operational networks and filling the risk capital gap facing innovative early-stage companies in developing Asia and the Pacific, particularly smaller and frontier markets.”

ADB differentiates itself from a typical VC fund by going beyond the sourcing and provision of capital. ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 (the facility’s anchor trust fund) is augmented by a $12 million technical assistance program that will be deployed to the startups over three years. The program is two-pronged, with the ADB Ventures SEED grant program promoting expansion into emerging markets and the validation and de-risking of technology pilots.

The second leg of the assistance program, ADB Venture Lab provides a suite of innovation programs and will generate technology pilot opportunities to the anchor fund’s portfolio companies.



The announcement echoes a recent wave of banks and other large institutions making significant pledges to allocate resources toward sustainable ventures and re-align their portfolios to meet self-imposed carbon neutral commitments.



Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BlackRock and JP Morgan are just a handful of industry leaders working toward these goals, some of which are also deploying impact investing funds to support environmentally focused fintechs.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), has established the ADB Ventures platform to feed investment and support to Asian startups which are developing solutions aimed at achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Organized by NITI Aayog in partnership with the North Eastern Council, Govt. of Assam, and Tata Trust, the conclave is supported by UNDP and RIS.

The inaugural session of the conclave started with an address from Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, followed by welcome remarks from Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister, Finance, Transformation & Development, Education & Health, Government of Assam. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog set the context for the Conclave, followed by Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

The three-day event, from 24 to 26 February, hinged on the premise of ‘Partnership, Cooperation and Development of North East States’, will see representation from the highest offices of all the State Governments of the north east, Central ministries, civil society organizations, academia, international development organizations and think tanks active in the north eastern region.

“India, especially the northeast region, offers unique challenges & opportunities. The solutions need interventions that bring disruptive change and, thus, fostering a tech-embedded development trajectory is of paramount importance,” said NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.

Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, focused on the need for mainstreaming the northeastern region in the national development agenda and identification of state specific and region specific priorities as key to SDG localisation.

“Several north eastern states rank on the top of NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index and the region is India’s bridge to South East Asia, and this presents immense opportunity for trade & commerce,” said Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

Chief Ministers of North Eastern states also addressed the inaugural session of the SDG Conclave. “In the coming days, we will partner will NITI Aayog for strengthening our resolve for SDGs. We have identified 145 state indicators linked to the CM dashboard, which has been monitoring the State’s progress for the last 2 years,” said Pema Khandu, CM of Arunachal Pradesh.

“With the financial help from the Central Government, as well as monitoring the progress made by north eastern states of India, I believe the SDGs can certainly be achieved,” said Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga.

“Through SDG Conclave 2020, we now have a regional space to learn from each other and from the rest of India. Sustainability is important for Himalayan states like Sikkim and how we harness our natural resources,” said Prem Singh Tamang, CM of Sikkim.

Chief Minister of Tripura, Biplab Kumar Deb, presented a goal wise analysis of Tripura’s progress towards achieving the ambitious Agenda 2030 by linking existing schemes and programmes.

“Guwahati will play a crucial role as it is India’s gateway to Southeast Asia. Together, with NITI Aayog’s support, we will continue our journey in ensuring the prosperity of the region and its people,” put forth Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam.

In his keynote address, Union Minister of State (MoS), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jitendra Singh, said, “When India becomes a $5 trillion economy, the north east will be an essential component”.

Another key highlight was the release of reports on challenges, prospects, and SDG best practices. The four reports released were: Compendium of State Indicator Frameworks of 8 North Eastern States; North East and SDGs by RIS and Tata Trusts; Stories of Change by Tata Trusts; and Best Practices Portfolio on North East by UNDP.

The inaugural session on the first day will be followed by technical sessions on 25 and 26 Feb. These sessions will include discussions pertaining to SDGs in the North Eastern Region: Pathways for Localisation and Achievement; Drivers of Economic Prosperity & Sustainable Livelihoods; Climate Adaptive Agriculture; Nutrition Security & Health and Wellbeing for All; Education, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; Communication, Connectivity and Infrastructure Development; Addressing Inequality and Exclusion in the North East and the Way Forward and Valedictory.

NITI Aayog has the mandate of overseeing the adoption and monitoring of SDGs at the national and sub-national level. Progress in the northeast region is crucial in this decade of action for the country to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and this conclave is part of NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts towards fostering partnerships at the sub-national level. In terms of SDG localisation, the states in the region have taken major strides in integrating the Agenda 2030.

47,https://thewire.in/government/water-sanitation-sdg-budget-2020,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Wire,Budget 2020 Sets India on the Path to Meet SDG Targets for Water and Sanitation,"The Central government has announced in the Budget through the allocations for the water and sanitation sectors, it aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. These are welcome steps given the critical condition of India’s water sector, which is highly stressed.

Water resources are limited. The water demand in all sectors by 2050 is estimated to exceed its supply. While demand is growing, the quality of water supply is dwindling. Per capita water supply is declining on an annual basis and is likely to touch the benchmark of water-scarce supply in the coming years. Groundwater levels are also decreasing, although globally, India is the highest user of groundwater, especially in irrigation and domestic sectors. Its quality is also a cause of concern.

SDG 6.1 stipulates achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking for all by 2030. Under the Jal Jivan Mission (JJM) scheme, India launched the programme to provide piped water connections (at 55 litres per head per day) to 14.6 crore rural households by 2024. An amount of Rs 3.6 lakh crore (with a Central share of Rs 2.08 lakh crore) has been approved for this scheme over the five year period. During 2020-21 (Table 1), an allocation of Rs 11,500 crore (15% more than the revised estimate for 2019-20) for connecting 1.15 crore household through functionally piped connections in rural areas, has been made. Under this programme, source sustainability measures for augmenting water supply through rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and management of greywater for reusing wastewater, have been envisaged through gram panchayats which should play a crucial role in planning, designing, execution, operations and maintenance of the in-village infrastructure.

SDG 6.2 goals are required to be achieved by India through access to adequate sanitation and hygiene for all, and ending open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women, girls, and those in vulnerable situations. Having made substantial progress under the Swachh Bharat Mission and declaring the country as open defecation free (ODF), India is determined to continue to take steps for liquid and solid faecal waste management, post toilet construction. Accordingly, it has allocated Rs 12,294 crore (25% more than the revised estimate of 2019-20) for FY 2020-21 for achieving the ‘ODF plus’ status of sanitation component. This is also a welcome step.

Water quality has to be improved by reducing pollution (SDG 6.3) by 2030. For cleaning the river, allocation of funds under Namami Gange (Rs 800 crore) for Ganga cleaning and National River conservation (Rs 840 crore) for cleaning other rivers, has been made during 2020-21. SDG 6.6 mandates protecting and restoring water-related ecosystem such as wetlands, rivers, aquifers. These two programmes address this aspect as well. There is no fund allocated for grey water management for recycling and reuse of wastewater as required under SDG (6.3), although this aspect is proposed to be covered under the JJM scheme while giving access to water.

India’s water use efficiency in all sectors is not satisfactory. For example, India’s water use is highest in the irrigation sector (80%) and its efficiency is only 38%. To address the improvement of the efficiency, PMKSY (‘per drop more crop’) scheme was launched using micro-irrigation technology. India’s potential for micro-irrigation is an area of 70 million hectares and the achievement till 2018 is only 9 million hectares. PMKSY is a Centrally sponsored scheme and states’ meaningful participation is essential. Budget 2020-21 allocated Rs 4,000 crore, which is almost double the RE 2019-2020 amount and is substantial.

Unfortunately, increasing water use efficiency in the domestic and industrial sectors was not touched upon in the Budget, although the SDG 6.4 mandates increasing efficiency in all sectors. To ensure sustainable water withdrawals, an allocation of Rs 200 crore under Atal Bhujal Yojana for incentivising and effective groundwater management is a welcome step. In addition, PMKSY (Har khet ko pani) and integrated watershed management have been allocated higher funds during 2020-21 for addressing source sustainability measures.

Given the allocation of funds for water and sanitation sectors was Rs 30,478 crore for 2020-21 (higher than the 2019-20 figure by about 20%), India’s commitment to implementing the SDG 6 goal is evident. Since water and sanitation are state subjects, the states’ full participation in the implementation of schemes is essential. Given the past achievements in sanitation sectors, there is much hope for overcoming the enormous challenges in the water sector.

48,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/role-of-libraries-in-sdg-implementation-1580916443,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Financial Express BD,Role of libraries in SDG implementation,"Bangladesh observed national library day on Wednesday (February 05). As the library remains unrestricted for all to provide any relevant services, including reading, access to information and research, it is termed a 'University for Public'. Library is basically a living apparatus which preserves all the information of the past for the use of the present generation and that creates link between the past and present generation for the utilisation of information for its future generation.

The United Nations (UN) held a meeting in New York at the end of September 2019 for adoption of the 2030 Agenda with a total of 169 targets spanning economic, environmental and social development. The global body outlined a plan for all countries to actively work for making the world better for peoples, without anyone left behind.

Libraries are essential platforms for achieving such objectives. Over the last few years, International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has been actively involved in formulation of the UN 2030 Agenda, promoting inclusion of access to information, safeguarding of cultural heritage, disaster risk reduction through climate literacy, universal literacy and access to ICT (information and communications) in the system. IFLA is the leading international body representing the interests of people who rely on libraries and information professionals.

Access to information was recognised as a priority in SDG 16 (target 16.10): ensuring public access to information and safeguarding fundamental freedoms in compliance with national legislation and international agreements.

Culture (target 11.4), climate literacy (SDG-13) and ICT (targets 5b, 9c, 17.8) have also been included in the SDGs. And, universal literacy is recognised in the vision for the UN 2030 Agenda.

Libraries all over the world are reliable organisations with access to information that is necessary to drive economic opportunity and community development. In many places, a library is the only place where people have access to information that will help better education, develop new skills, find jobs, build businesses, make informed farming and health decisions, or gain insights into environmental issues.

The UN SDGs are now common goals and each country will be responsible for developing and implementing national policies to achieve them, and it is expected that it will track and report its own progress towards each goal.

HOW TO GET INVOLVED: In Bangladesh, libraries now need to demonstrate that they can accelerate change across the whole range of 2030 Agenda. Everyone within and beyond the library community can help foster the role of libraries as development supporters.

IFLA suggests that it is now vital to negotiate with government decision-makers to ensure awareness of the role of libraries as development engines, and to ensure that libraries obtain the funding needed to continue this work. Increasing visibility inside and beyond the library community by arranging events, use of the social media, websites for updating library technology and services, forums, and mailing the users are useful to demonstrate contribution of libraries to helping the country's growth.

Library associations and members should be involved in advocacy work at national and regional levels to ensure reliable public access to information through library services and programmes.

SDG FRAMEWORK: Very recently, as part of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, some 20 library members, along with other guests, gathered at the Australian Library Association (ALIA) House in Canberra to discuss goals for Australian libraries. They developed 17 SDG goals and 169 SDG targets and are divided into three sections: Priorities for Australian library services, contribution to society and Global citizenship through the prism of the people who attended the roundtable. In every section there are multiple subsections which reflect targets, explanation, role of actors to achieve the targets, indicators, measures taken by leading institutions and timeframe to achieve the goals.

Australian copyright legislation supports open access; equitable access; culture and heritage; literacy and lifelong learning.

It is unfortunate that the library associations in Bangladesh are not yet members of IFLA. It's time to be actively engaged with libraries and library associations internationally.

“Here it is finally, after all this time we’re here awarding the project for the Crysler Bridge,” he said. We’re very happy with the price. This is a full rehabilitation of the bridge and it is on budget.”

The project will see the county spend $1,533,000 on the rehabilitation, plus the harmonized sales tax. Tenders for the project had initially been issued last year, but every one of them had been over budget. This resulted in SDG staff modifying the project, cutting down on its cost.

“Last year’s low bid was $1.9 million and our budget was of $1.2 million,” said de Haan. “So we obviously made adjustments to the tender, as you can see. Some of those changes include extending the construction schedule.”","Article contentCrysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

The first group is made up of those who adversely criticize whatever President Muhammadu Buhari does or fails to do, while the second group consists of those who see no wrong whatsoever in the activities of Buhari’s government.

The two groups have something in common which is that most Nigerians do not understand either of them.

Perhaps because both groups are unaware of this situation, they have continued to seize every opportunity to eloquently disagree with one another on every subject so as to convince us that they have good points either way.

So, when Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki last week painted a frightening picture but which looks like a true story of the precarious Nigerian economy, the resultant huge war of words between the pro and anti-Buhari crusaders especially the non-state actors could not have surprised any analyst who has followed street debates in the country.

As if to sensitize people on the state of the nation’s economy, Obaseki had raised an alarm that our finances have gone so low that last month,government had to print more money for states to share to meet their obligations.

This was unacceptable to some people who decided to react to the allegation. First, was an unsigned statement that government was unaware of any printing of money as alleged. One comedian immediately tweeted that “the man didn’t say you were aware, he said you printed.

”The second reaction described the governor’s alarm as a lie while the third educated us on the correct terminology for what happened – lending, not printing. Painfully, what should be of concern to us has been buried by the controversy.

The fact that what was shared was a form of loan seems to establish that there was not enough to share. Whether the extra that was borrowed was printed or conjured by a magician cannot controvert the fact that Nigeria is hugely broke.

If such truth must be told to put our status in correct perspective, then Obaseki’s alarm can hardly be wished away especially if his entire statement and not just theexcerpt on printing is read in full.

Indeed, there are vital parts of the statement that have been ignored. For the benefit of those who may not have read Obaseki’s statement, here is a crucial aspect that ought not to be downplayedor discountenanced.

According to the governor, “everywhere else, governments rely on the people to produce taxes and that is what they use to run the local government, state and the federation.

But with the way we run Nigeria, the country can go to sleep. At the end of the month, we just go to Abuja, collect money and we come back to spend.

We are in trouble, huge financial trouble. The current price of crude oil is only a mirage. The major oil companies who are the ones producing are no longer investing much in oil.

Shell is pulling out of Nigeria and Chevron is now one of the world’s largest investors in alternative fuel, so in another year or so, where will we find this money that we go to share in Abuja?”

This quotation is no doubt a veritable wake-up call for us all to rise to the occasion and change our spending habit.

This is more so when the governor also clearly stated that it would be unfair for Nigerians to expect one man – Buhari, to be left alone to face the enormous problems.

In other words, the governor’s statement created no room for claims and counter claims amongst politicians or supporters.

It is also important to make the point that this is not the first time some of us are getting confused about the internal sources of Nigeria’s colossal loans.

Last month, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) announced that his corporation could no longer bear the huge subsidy payments of over N120 billion monthly subsidy for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).

The NNPC according to Kyari has been absorbing the cost differential between the actual and selling cost of the product by recording it in its financial books.

Not many understood the statement. From which of its books does NNPC get such huge sums every month?

If NNPC had been paying all its funds into the Federation Account as legally expected what magic does the Corporation employ to accommodate massive subsidy payments; is it by merely writing the amounts in its books?

Indeed, during the peak of the Covid 19 pandemic, there were certain expenses which Nigeria was too broke to accommodate and which both the NNPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), graciously accepted to co-settle.

Do these two bodies have their own supply of funds? Answers to a question such as this may illuminate the state of Nigeria’s finances Is Nigeria really in financial trouble, if so, to what extent?

The latest answer to this question was given a few days ago by Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed who said “the nation’s debt profile was still within sustainable limit.”

The statement was quite comforting on its face value but the situation on ground appears to counter it because if we still have capacity to borrow more, why not go ahead and resolve the numerous issues waiting to be settled?

From basic economics we can imagine that our current inflation rate reflects a decline in the purchasing power of our naira which is itself not available to many. Only last week, the National Bureau of Statistics released her consumer price index (CPI) for March 2021.

In the report,inflation was said to have risen to 18% in March representing 0.82% when compared to 17% recorded in February.

Similarly, food inflation rose by 5.0% to 23% in March from 22 percent in February. The report is worth worrying about especially as the scarce funds available are swallowed by personnel costs across the nation. How do we develop?

The body language of the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele at the press conference where he was requested to react to Obaseki’s comment, showed he was visibly upset that his sacrifices do not appear appreciated.

Of course no responsible CBN can watch her nation in trouble without intervening. Again, no one doubts that our CBN has never been this stressed in history.

Governor Emefiele must take solace in the fact that he has been able to withstand the vagaries of the economic weather of Nigeria in the last couple of troublesome years.

To say that Nigeria is super broke is not an indictment but telling the truth about our situation for general enlightenment.

One of the advantages of educating people on the true status of our economy is that it can have an effect on the increasing demands by different striking Nigerian workers on all kinds of expectations.

What displeases Nigerians is not the disclosure of the true state of their nation’s economy but the transparent inequity where at this critical stage, some people still enjoy wardrobe, newspaper or other forms of annoying comfort while others are dying.

The Golden Raiders, coached by Ian Wilson, took the first set 25-12, but the Panthers would rally and get even with a 25-21 win in the second game. Cornwall Collegiate went back out in front with a 25-15 decision in the third set. The fourth set was tight, 22-21, but the Golden Raiders were able to get on a run and pull away to a 25-22 victory.

“We traded points back and forth before we were able to pull away (down the stretch),” Wilson said.

It was somewhat of an unlikely local conclusion for the Golden Raiders, who had to overcome a considerable amount of adversity this winter.

“Our season started with three girls on the injured list, with sprained ankles, dislocated knees and wisdom teeth surgery,” Wilson said.

But, when everyone was available, the Golden Raiders were a force, charging to an 8-2 regular season record.

Their next challenge will be on Wednesday, playing at the eastern Ontario championships in Pembroke. The winner of the tournament will move on to the OFSAA provincials to be played early in March.","Article contentFor the first time in eight years, the Cornwall Collegiate Golden Raiders are senior girls volleyball champs in SDG.

Caritas Sierra Leone, in partnership with the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) and the Bartlet Development Planning Unit, has launched a report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030 on the theme: ‘Bringing Agenda 2030 to Life’.

The report titled: ‘Sierra Leone Sustainable Development’ was launched at the Family Kingdom hall in Freetown on the Wednesday. It focuses on four principles of the 17 SDGs. Principle one deals with leave no one behind, Principle two focuses on tackling inequalities, the third principle touches on integrating the environment and development, while principle four deals with participation and dialogue.

In his opening statement at the launching ceremony, Reverend Henry Aruna, President of Caritas Sierra Leone, explained that the report is the result of a participatory research his organization conducted on the SDGs in partnership with Caritas Africa, CAFOD, the University College London, and the National Commission for Justice, Peace and Caritas Liberia (NCJPC), Caritas Kenya and Caritas Zambia. He said these principles the report focused on underpin the transformative aspirations of the 2030 SDGs.

“The report aims to provide ideas to policy makers on how to do development differently through the SDGs and also use the transformational principles of the SDGs backed by the Pope’s ‘Encyclical Laudato Si’ to incentivize policies that will lead to transformative change,” he explained.

Rev. Aruna noted that there would be challenges in the implementation of these principles, but said that the Church and other faith-based organizations had a critical role in the attainment of the SDGs by 2030 in Sierra Leone.

Ejuma Amen-Thomson, representative of CAFOD, noted that the report in Sierra Leone was just one of several reports published across the continent which highlighted new and innovative ways to incorporate SDGs in to policy making and development agendas.

“In this report from Caritas Sierra Leone, we see a way forward in the development of inclusive policy making and new innovative ways of thinking about development of the communities and people across Sierra Leone,” she said.

In his statement, Yusuf Mackey, Chairman of Parliamentary Committee on SDGs, said that Parliamentarians had an opportunity and constitutional responsibility to play a significant role in supporting and monitoring the implementation of the SDGs.

“Members of Parliament are uniquely positioned to act as an interface body between the people, state institutions and other developmental organizations, and to promote and adopt people-centered policies and legislations to ensure that no one is left behind,” he said.

In his keynote address, the Deputy Minister of Planning and Economic Development, Dr. Robert Chakanda, noted that the four principles analyzed in the report were key principles in the country’s Medium Term National Development Plan (2019-2023).

“Our last year’s reporting to the United Nations on the SDGs covered all strategic areas in this report, as to how well Sierra Leone had progressed in advancing these principles through the implementation of our national Development Plan,” he said.

He added: “We are therefore very optimistic that implementation of the 11 key findings and recommendations of the caritas report – bringing SDGs to Life - will certainly increase our national and global performance in the SDGs,” he noted.

The report launch was climaxed by presentation of case studies on the four principles with testimonies from people from different projects in line with the principles.

I’ve been there, it’s quarantined off.” Roumeliotis pointed to the fact the quarantined area is currently manned by Canadian Red Cross workers, Army personnel, public health agency workers and an emergency management medical assistance team. “If I was infected and coughed, it would go a couple of feet but drop to the ground and stay there,” he said. “If someone happened to touch it, they might get infected— but it’s not going to be airborne and going into ventilation like other viruses do.”

Posted by Eastern Ontario Health Unit on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 In its regular update on Tuesday, the EOHU indicated the testing laboratory set up at CFB Trenton would now be moving to the Nav Centre as the people quarantined in Trenton reached the end of their 14-day stay and were released. The daily update also indicated one person at the Nav Centre was transported to Cornwall Community Hospital on Monday for medical reasons unrelated to the COVID-19. “There were transfers of quarantined individuals to hospitals in Trenton for medical reasons not related to COVID-19, and we do expect them here as well,” Roumeliotis is quoted as saying in the update— though he did not volunteer this information during his update to city council Monday. All precautions were taken by Cornwall-SDG EMS in transporting the person, and the Cornwall Community Hospital is equipped and prepared to isolate the person while providing treatment. If well enough to be released before the 14-day quarantine is lifted, the person would return to the Nav Centre. During his presentation, Roumeliotis praised the quarantine area, calling it an ideal location, being completely walled off and having a tunnel leading to it. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking to Nav employees,” he said. “I know that some are worried. I’m also getting phone calls from schools saying that kids are being bullied now because their parents work at the Nav. Some parents are refusing to send their kids to daycares and to schools because their parents are working at the Nav Centre.”

Dr John Adabie Appiah, the President of PSG, who made the call said access to paediatric services was increasing across the country and has become necessary to have more experts to expand their services to every corner of the country.

Dr Appiah was speaking at the PSG’s two-day maiden Annual General and Scientific Meeting in Accra on the theme; “Building Partnerships to Achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3”.

The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Newborns, children and adolescents in Ghana are faced with a myriad of health challenges, which must be addressed holistically.

He said with the failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, Ghana has no excuse but to accelerate efforts to be counted among the ‘elite’ nations of SDG high-fliers.

“This calls for more than doubling our efforts, pooling resources together and working with each other and trust that we can do better,” he stated.

According to him, the Society was seriously looking into the uneven distribution of child health experts in some parts of the country adding that, this is a major issue, which compromised the quality of care.

Dr Appiah said in as much as Ghanaian child health experts are taking up positions across the country than before, there was the need to identify additional factors and dynamics contributing to child mortality.

He called on skilled personnel to address problems such as lower respiratory tract infections and sustain immunization to save children.

Mrs Cynthia Morrison, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, commended the Society for meeting to further discuss the well-being of children.

She said Ghana had demonstrated clear commitment by ensuring that the SDGs were maintained and coordinated into the President’s programme of economic and social development policy.

In achieving the goals, the Ministry she said adopted a multi sectorial approach in the implementation of its policies and programmes.

“To further strengthen inter agency partnership to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages, an inter-sectorial standard operating procedure for child protection and family welfare development for children under zero to three have been finalized under the early Childhood Care and Development policy,” she said.

This policy including others give the overall framework direction for protection and promotion of the vulnerable.

This, she said, could not be achieved by the Ministry alone but needed partnerships to ensure common goals and targets and urged all not to relent on their efforts in achieving the SGDs.

Mrs Linda Asante-Agyei, the Vice President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), speaking on the role of the media in achieving the SGD 3, urged journalists to ensure that policies and laws regarding the well- being of children were implemented through their writings.

She said Ghana has made tremendous progress on new policies such as the Child and Family Welfare Policy and Justice for All Children policy and advised journalists to monitor commitments made by government and other organizations through continuous tracking and assessment of programmes.

“We must ensure that children receive the best care and improve their wellbeing to take up the mantle of developing the nation,” she noted.

Mrs Asante-Agyei urged the PSG to deepen their collaboration with the GJA to ensure that journalists report effectively on children issues.

She said this was important as it would help do away with wrong reporting on children since they were sensitive group of people.

The two day programme witnessed a lot of presentations, business meeting, exhibitions, awards and dinner dance.","The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

56,https://trade4devnews.enhancedif.org/en/op-ed/achieving-sdg-2-policy-options-and-their-trade-offs,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Trade for Development News,Achieving SDG 2: Policy options and their trade-offs,"SDG 2 commits governments to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, with five specific targets setting the level and ambition of this goal. With trade recognized as a “means of implementation” under Agenda 2030, policymakers need to ensure that measures affecting trade and markets take into consideration efforts to achieve SDG 2. Resolving the trade-offs between competing policy objectives requires meaningful analysis and discussion within the context of multilateral agreements, to take account of the measures that could contribute to achieving SDG 2.

The five specific targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aim for improvements related to a range of issues. The targets are: end hunger (2.1); end all forms of malnutrition (2.2); double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (2.3); ensure sustainable food production systems (2.4); and maintain genetic diversity (2.5).

This is ambitious, given the current situation.

According to the most recent estimates, 821.6 million, or one out of every 10 people in the world, are undernourished, and roughly 728 million people are estimated to be obese. And, there are 736 million people living in extreme poverty, with a majority engaged in the agri-food sector. At the same time, agricultural production systems face a number of environmental challenges related to soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and water use and pollution.

Trade and related policies play a significant role in this context, as governments often use such measures to address food security as well as agricultural development objectives. Policies that can affect trade and markets include border measures like tariffs, export restrictions and non-tariff measures, as well as “behind-the-border” domestic support such as input and output subsidies, market price support, public investments in infrastructure and R&D, and some forms of income support programmes.

The domestic and international impacts of each of these policies can differ depending on whether the country is a net exporter or importer, a small or big producer or consumer, and the way in which policies are designed and implemented.

In addition, impacts may differ in the short versus longer run.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.

ON COMPETING PRIORITIES

The use of export restrictions is an example of competing priorities of a border measure, in particular between short- and longer-run objectives within the domestic market, and between the policy objectives of two trading partners. Export restrictions are usually used to address domestic food security concerns related to rising food prices. Such measures often have the immediate effect of increasing food availability and lowering food prices in domestic markets, therefore contributing to the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. However, there might be negative implications for producer incomes (SDG target 2.3), which may be significantly reduced by lower food prices.

In the medium-to-long run, the initial effects of such a policy may be completely reversed as farmers respond to lower prices and policy uncertainty by decreasing cultivated areas. This can contribute to lower production and higher prices in the medium-to-long run, thus mitigating the initial positive implications of the measure for SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. Furthermore, the application of export restrictions can undermine the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2 in importing countries by lowering food availability on world markets and contributing to higher prices, particularly if measures are implemented simultaneously by many exporting countries.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.



Behind-the-border measures such as input subsidies and market price support measures also involve important choices between different policy objectives. They can have positive implications for the achievement of SDG target 2.3 as they can improve farmer incomes. However, in addition to their high fiscal cost and administrative burden, they can negatively affect the achievement of SDG target 2.4, in particular if they provide production incentives for products with high GHG emissions.

In addition, there might be consequences related to SDG target 2.3 at an international level as such measures may lower prices and undermine the opportunity for small-scale producers in the importing country to sell their products in international markets.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTILATERAL TRADE RULES

Some measures generally have positive implications for the achievement of SDG 2 targets. These include public investments in infrastructure like storage facilities that can improve farmer prices (affecting SDG target 2.3), rural roads that can connect producers to markets (affecting SDG target 2.3), and efficiencies in trade and logistics that can reduce food waste and bring farm products where they are needed (affecting SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2).

As these measures do not typically involve transfers to individual producers, they usually fall under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) green box category and are not subject to any limitation. Moreover, the first means of implementation target of SDG 2 (i.e. 2.A), commits countries to “increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks…”

For other measures that can have production and trade-distorting effects, not only are they subject to limits in the multilateral trading system, but SDG 2’s other two means of implementation targets focus on improving the functioning of agricultural markets. In particular, target 2.B commits countries to “correct and prevent distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect…”

While progress on indicator 2.B has been made with the WTO Nairobi Ministerial Decision, achieving SDG 2 and resolving the trade-offs requires that governments go beyond a narrow focus on the elimination of export subsidies. Instead, policymakers need to take a broader approach to indicators of progress that encompass a range of measures that affect trade and markets in the global food system.

The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

The UNECE Statistical Division prepared the first annual SDG progress report to inform the 2020 RFSD.

It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

The report aims to inform the region’s progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

The Arab region’s 2020 Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD) has been postponed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.

Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones. In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework. She also provided an oral update to the report, noting that on indicator 3.8.1, the refinement has been changed to “coverage of essential health services,” meaning that the indicator “basically goes back to what it was before.”

She also highlighted that:

The IAEG proposes establishing a working group for measuring development support more broadly than through official development assistance (ODA) – “total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD)”. An additional indicator on TOSSD had been proposed during the comprehensive review process, but members differed over the methodology. The Group agreed to work further on this potential indicator for submission to the Commission in 2022, and to establish a working group to this end.

Data disaggregation is a main area of work for 2020, to ensure “no one is left behind,” and the IEAG aims to develop guidelines on tools and methodologies on data disaggregation and to help build national capacity; and

The Group has issued a report on interlinkages between the Goals and targets both statistically and through a policy and legislation lens, to support deeper analysis of the 2030 Agenda.

Member States, some of whom are IAEG members, made numerous remarks. Several welcomed the fact that the changes to the framework had been limited so as not to increase the overall burden on national statistical organizations, while increasing the quality of the framework. Some expressed support for specific changes, such as the addition of an indicator on civil justice (16.3.3), the additional of an indicator on total greenhouse gas emissions per year (indicator 13.2.2), and in a revision to indicator 15.9.1, the integration of biodiversity into national accounting under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.

Speakers expressed concern on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on employment in sustainable tourism.

On other changes, the speakers expressed concern, including on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on the proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs. China voiced concern about, among others, the addition of the GHG emissions indicator, noting that the global response to climate change should focus on equity and preserve each country’s equal right to development.

The United Arab Emirates suggested “cancelling” all indicators that remain in Tier 3, given the relatively short time left to implement them. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) lamented the lack of an indicator for older persons under SDG target 2.2. on malnutrition.

The African Group recommended reinforced collaboration and coordination with regional commissions. Others called for improved coordination between the custodian agencies for the indicators and national governments.

Revisiting the discussion on 6 March 2020 with the aim of approving the Commission’s report on the proposed changes (E/CN3/2020/L.3, draft decision 1), many delegations reiterated their concern about deleting indicator 8.9.2 on sustainable tourism employment.

The Director of the UN Statistics Division Stefan Schweinfest recalled that the comprehensive review process had been lengthy and “very complex” and had resulted in a “package deal.” This would make reconsidering the decision on one indicator a “dangerous path,” he said, urging delegations to accept the premise of a compromise. Speaking on the “painful” impacts of deleting 8.9.2, Suriname urged that the report reflect that “part of the Commission does not accept this…. Some countries are saying this is not okay.”

The report of the IAEG was adopted as orally revised, and it “agreed to and adopted the proposed major changes and minor refinements … while noting concerns regarding specific indicators, and recognized that the work on SDG indicators is work in progress.” The amended text also indicates that the IAEG is requested to continue its annual refinement, research and methodological work including on “policy issues such as sustainable tourism and climate change.”

Another oral revision to the report adds wording on “the importance of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for SDG monitoring.”

At the closing of the 51st session, Commission Chair Shigeru Kawasaki (Japan) expressed satisfaction that “the SDG indicator framework is advancing, although there is still some room for improvement … we are in a very promising situation.” [Meeting webcast, 3 March 2020] [Meeting webcast, 6 March 2020]","The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs.

The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.” It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.

The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.

Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.

The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds, inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.

To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:

achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;

“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; and

in the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.

The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.

In some areas, work is shifting to alternative virtual formats, such as the UN’s Fifth Committee on administrative and budgetary matters.

By early March, a number of announcements regarding the postponement or cancellation of meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic had been made. The UN Commission on the Status of Women held a historically short meeting for its 64th session, convening for a half-day on 9 March 2020 to adopt a political declaration before suspending. The CSW usually brings together thousands of participants the world for a two-week session and hundreds of side events.

Also acting early to adjust major plans were the World Bank and IMF, which transitioned the annual Spring Meetings scheduled for mid-April to a virtual format. The World Bank announced that it would cancel or postpone “all major events and conferences until further notice,” including the cancellation of the 2020 Land and Poverty Conference scheduled for 16-20 March. In cancelling the 19th session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which was scheduled for April 2020, members of the Forum noted the “already precarious health situation that many indigenous peoples live in, and the imperative to avoid adverse impacts.”

On 10 March, the ECOSOC Youth Forum and a Youth Plenary in preparation for the UN’s 75th anniversary were postponed. On 11 March, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to postpone the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 4) on an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), with new dates to be determined (decision 74/543). IGC 4 had been scheduled to convene from 23 March to 3 April. UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also announced that two high-level events would not go forward: the High-level Interactive Panel on Anti-microbial Resistance, scheduled for 14 April 2020; and the High-level event to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, scheduled for 24 April 2020.

On 11 March, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) circulated a list of proposed changes to the Council’s meeting calendar, inviting Member States’ views. She subsequently announced instead, “we need to remain flexible.”

On 17 March, the UNGA President announced that in-person, formal meetings of the UNGA “should not be organized at this time.” He suggested that the UNGA adopt any essential decisions via silence procedure, and agreeing on a simple procedure for postponing meetings. By a separate letter, he said he had decided to cancel all in-person meetings of the UNGA’s mandated processes for the 74th session that are scheduled to be held up to 17 April 2020, stating that, “These processes will conduct their activities via alternative mechanisms.” On mandated UNGA events scheduled for after 17 April 2020, he said discussions are ongoing.

The UNGA President said officials are considering alternative ways to adopt key decisions (instead of in-person meetings), and that the UNGA’s Fifth Committee has “successfully started conducting informal meetings via the UN’s Video Conference Tool (VCT).” ECOSOC, too, is exploring virtual options and solutions, according to the President’s statement on 18 March.

Additional ECOSOC meetings and events have been postponed or cancelled, as follows:

The 19th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), 30 March-3 April: Postponed

2020 ECOSOC Partnership Forum, 3 April: Cancelled

2020 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum), 20-23 April: Postponed until after April 2020

SDG Investment Fair, 20-22 April: Cancelled

Other ECOSOC meetings that fall within the eight-week timeframe are:

The UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), 4-8 May; and

The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum), 12-13 May.

Later in May, the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) is scheduled for 14-15 May, and the ECOSOC segment on Operational Activities for Development (OAS) is planned to convene from 19-21 May.

Negotiations on outcome documents of upcoming meetings, such as the ministerial declaration of the HLPF/high-level segment of ECOSOC in July 2020, may not take place in person.

Four out of five of the UN regions have had to postpone their annual regional fora for sustainable development or switch to a virtual format. The exception is the UN Economic Commission for Africa, which convened the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) from 24-27 February 2020. These regional sessions comprise an important part of the preparations for the July session of the HLPF.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) has been organizing preparations for the fifth UN conference on the LDCs, which will convene in Qatar in 2021 (UNLDC-V). Regional review meetings to inform these preparations have been postponed both for Africa, in Malawi, and Asia-Pacific, in Bangladesh.

On climate change, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is not organizing in-person meetings until the end of April 2020 and official missions have been suspended. The regional climate weeks have been postponed, as has the 2020 NAP Expo among other planned meetings. The Adaptation Committee will meet virtually instead of its in-person meeting from 24-27 March.

On biodiversity, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced the postponement of a number of meetings, including the 24th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice of the CBD and the third Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation of the CBD. Both of these meetings are expected to feed into the preparations for the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is scheduled to take place in October 2020, in China and is expected to adopt a global biodiversity framework for the post-2020 period.

On chemicals and waste management, the fourth meeting of the intersessional process for Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 was postponed, having been scheduled to convene in Bucharest, Romania, from 23-27 March 2020. The meeting will feed into the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), which is scheduled to take place from 5-9 October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.

The Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm has announced that an upcoming meeting in Ottawa, Canada and an upcoming meeting in Rome, Italy have been suspended, while the first meeting of the small intersessional working group on the strategic framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention for 2012–2021, scheduled for 31 March to 2 April 2020, will take place online. Preparations are continuing for the 2020 COP meetings of each convention, and a final decision will be made five weeks before the scheduled dates. These meetings, all scheduled to convene in Geneva, are:

The Summit explored how to attain SDG target 2.5, which calls on the international community to maintain the genetic diversity of both crops and livestock by 2020, and promote access and benefit sharing.

The Summit highlighted concerns that following decades of steady improvements to food security, the number of people living with hunger began to increase in 2015. More than 820 million people are currently undernourished, according to the 2019 UN report ‘State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World.’ The Summit underscored the role of genetic diversity in transforming food systems and sustainable agriculture, while also strengthening the resilience of ecosystems, reducing the vulnerability of rural populations to climate impacts, and contributing to climate change mitigation.

Emphasizing the interrelated nature of the SDGs, the Seed Summit issued a Call to Action that urges governments to step up efforts to maintain genetic diversity, “including through soundly managed seed and plant banks,” and encourages gene banks to make use of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing important seed collections.

The Call to Action also highlights the importance of prioritizing the sustainable use and conservation of agricultural biodiversity in agricultural policies, and ensuring equitable sharing of benefits arising from these resources. It further notes the need for governments, researchers, the private sector, and civil society to step up their efforts to promote climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in both agriculture and aquaculture, with a view to ensuring that small-scale food producers can maintain and increase their food production in a changing climate.

The UN Secretary-General will host the 2021 Summit on Food Systems, which will seek to catalyze large-scale public mobilization and actionable commitments to make food systems sustainable, climate adapted, and resilient.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is “the ultimate insurance policy for the world’s food supply.”

During the ceremony, Kent Nnadozie, Secretary of the FAO International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, described the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as “the ultimate insurance policy for the world’s food supply.” It contains the world’s largest global backup collection of seed samples from food and forage crops, representing over 6,000 plant species. The vault was established in 2008, four years after the entry into force of the Treaty, which put in place a legal framework ensuring that seeds in the vault remain the sovereign property of the depositors who seal the containers upon deposit, and are the only ones permitted to access them again.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is equipped to store up to 4.5 million seeds samples, and is designed to preserve the seeds, keeping them viable for regeneration for decades, or even centuries to come. The latest deposits by 35 gene banks from around the world brought the total number of seed samples stored to over 1.1 million. Among first-time depositors at the Seed Vault event were the Cherokee Nation (USA), the University of Haifa (Israel), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Morocco), the Julius Kühn Institute (Germany), the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, the Baekdudaegan National Arboretum (South Korea), Suceava Genebank ‘Mihai Cristea’ (Romania), and Kew Gardens (UK).

The Seed Vault is managed by a partnership between the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food, NordGen and the Crop Trust.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite implementation challenges, there is evidence of “significant progress” in several areas, including waste management.

The ‘Tuvalu Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026’ is the main national policy framework to guide the management of waste in the country with the vision of having “A Cleaner and Healthier Tuvalu for today and future generations.”

The Policy and Action Plan acknowledges that its development is a “timely response to the significant changes happening in the waste sector in the Pacific Region and globally.” These changes include an increase in waste generated on the islands that has come about due to a proliferation of consumption of “more wasteful imported products,” according to the Plan. Excess waste presents a significant challenge, considering the “extremely limited land mass” of atoll countries such as Tuvalu.

The Policy and Action Plan, endorsed by the Government of Tuvalu in 2016, consists of six goals:

Strengthened institutional systems to address gaps in waste management;

The stakeholders fully understand the merits of proper waste management and co-share the responsibility of managing waste;

Establish strong public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the delivery of waste services;

Delivered waste services follow best practice and are cost-effective;

Enhanced capacity of waste practitioners; and

Waste activity outcomes are reported and disseminated to relevant stakeholders.

The last goal of the Policy and Action Plan is achieved, in part, through the conduct of annual reviews of the implementation status of the Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan. Since 2016, two annual reviews have been conducted. The latest one was released in May 2019, and covers the period from January 2018 to March 2019.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite challenges to implementation of the Waste Policy and Action Plan, there is evidence of “significant progress” especially on goals two, three, and five due to the Department of Waste Management elevating these to the national level with the support of key stakeholders. The report also outlines progress on achieving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as: review existing waste-related legislation and merge into one Act; develop specific regulations to support strict enforcement of the new waste legislation; allocate reasonable budget for waste services; implement public awareness programmes involving communities and schools in all waste service areas in the Tuvaluan language; reduce occupational and public health and safety incidents by 50%; 100% coverage of collection in the main island and at least 80% coverage of collection in the outer islands; and exploration and participation in information exchange programmes with other countries within and outside the region.

Tuvalu is aiming to transform towards a circular economy as the country sees it as the only way to address the increasing amount of waste that ends up in landfills annually and to achieve SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols. To do so, Tuvalu is strengthening engagement with the private sector in order to explore opportunities to reduce the amount of disposable waste and to ensure that all recyclable waste is shipped overseas for proper treatment and processing.

Tuvalu is also actively engaged in the EU-funded Pacific Waste Management Programme (PacWastePlus), implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), to further strengthen the country’s waste management. This project especially focuses on e-waste streams as a national waste priority, and provides technical assistance in Tuvalu’s transition towards a circular economy. The PacWastePlus programme, which is working with 14 Pacific countries and Timor-Leste, has a strong focus on improving data collection, information sharing, and education and awareness. The project also works with countries on developing and implementing policies and regulatory frameworks, implementing best practices to enhance private sector engagement and infrastructure development, and human capacity.

Yet the 2019 Annual Review recognizes that the enforcement of government waste management-related legislation, regulations, and policies is “generally weak,” which is related to a lack public awareness and education programmes carried out thus far. The report outlines emergent waste issues of importance for Tuvalu such as marine litter, healthcare waste, asbestos, and sewage and sludge. To mitigate these emergent issues, the Annual Review recommends the incorporation in the refined action plan 2017-2021 of measures, including:

Enforcement of law on illegal dumping along the coastline;

Regular monitoring of ships’ compliance with waste management standards;

Enforcement of law on littering;

Putting in place a proper healthcare waste management system;

Public awareness and education on asbestos features and their locations in Tuvalu;

Installation of a proper treatment system for sewage and sludge; and

Women groups taking the lead on addressing illegal dumping and littering problems.

Finally, the Annual Review cautions that, due to the nature of the policy goals, it will take time to realize some of the impacts, particularly those related to the need to change people’s attitudes to waste.

66,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/asia-and-pacific-sdg-progress-report-2020,"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020 - World,"Striking lack of progress on environmental SDGs in Asia-Pacific, reveals new UN report

There is overwhelming evidence that the Asia-Pacific region needs to accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and substantially reverse current negative trends, especially those which are depleting and degrading its environmental resources, according to a new report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020 draws attention to the region’s poor performance on most of the measurable environmental targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example, the share of renewable energy has dropped to 16 per cent, one of the lowest rates globally. The region also emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas - a number which has doubled since 2000. 35 per cent of countries continue to lose their forests.

“Our analysis finds that the Asia-Pacific region has struggled the most with two Goals: advancing responsible consumption and production, and climate action. In fact, the region is not even moving in the right direction,” underscored United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.

“These findings sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies,” added Ms. Alisjahbana.

On a positive note, many countries are moving decisively and showing remarkable progress in improving the quality of education (Goal 4) and providing access to affordable and clean energy (Goal 7). The Report suggests that achieving these two Goals is well within reach. The region is also making good progress on targets related to economic growth. Real GDP per capita growth in the Asia-Pacific was more than double the world average in 2017, and at the same time, at least 18 countries in the region are experiencing less income inequality.

Yet, to grow more sustainably and equitably, the current economic progress of the region must be coupled with human well-being and a healthy environment. Progress has been far too slow in areas such as gender equality (Goal 5) and building sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). ESCAP warns that the region remains unlikely to meet any of the 17 SDGs by 2030 without concerted and extra efforts from all stakeholders.

Progress has also been uneven across the five Asia-Pacific subregions, most especially in reducing inequalities (Goal 10), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), and peace, justice and strong institutions (Goal 16). A positive example of collective progress across all five subregions however is on access to electricity, where steady improvement is noticeable, particularly in rural areas.

Data availability for the SDG indicators has substantially increased over the past few years in Asia and the Pacific, from 25 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent in 2020. But data is still lacking on over half of the SDG indicators, especially those Goals with slow progress. This, according to ESCAP, highlights the urgent need to strengthen the policy-data nexus in the region.

A flagship annual publication produced by ESCAP, in partnership with five other UN agencies, the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report uses the latest data for global SDG indicators to determine where additional effort is needed in the region and where momentum for future progress is building.

67,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/icao-identifies-six-eligible-carbon-offsetting-programmes-for-aviation-industry/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICAO Identifies Six Eligible Carbon-Offsetting Programmes for Aviation Industry,"Recent meetings organized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), addressed steps by ICAO to address the aviation industry’s negative environmental externalities.

At the ICAO Council meeting, which convened from 2-20 March 2020, in Montréal, Canada, the Council adopted a standard to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health, and took further decisions on implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA is a market-based mechanism adopted in 2016 to achieve ICAO’s goals of increasing fuel efficiency by 2% per year and carbon-neutral growth of civil aviation from 2020 onwards. The mechanism aims to cap aviation’s future emissions growth by obliging airlines to buy offsets, rather than reducing their aircraft emissions.

The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase. These six programmes are:

American Carbon Registry

China Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Voluntary Emission Reduction Program

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Climate Action Reserve

The Gold Standard

Verified Carbon Standard

The Council’s decision follows recommendations by the Technical Advisory Body (TAB), which it established and tasked with evaluating whether carbon-offsetting programs satisfy the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). Public comments were also received, including from experts at Europe-based research institutes Öko-Institut, Perspectives, and Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), who published their analysis of 14 carbon-offsetting programs in October 2019.

In accordance with TAB’s recommendations on “eligibility timeframe” and “unit date eligibility,” the emissions units are issued to activities that commenced as of 1 January 2016, and in respect of emissions reductions occurring through 31 December 2020, subject to each programme’s scope of eligibility. The list of eligible emissions units will eventually be publicly available on the ICAO CORSIA website.

In its assessment and recommendation of programmes, TAB highlighted the following criteria:

Permanence: Carbon offset credits must represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or carbon sequestration that are permanent, whereby any given risk of reductions or removals being reversed require that either such credits are not eligible or measures are in place to monitor, mitigate, and compensate incidences of material leakage.

Additionality: Carbon offset programmes must generate units that represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or removals that are additional, including that they exceed any GHG reduction or removals required by law, regulation, or legally binding mandate.

Avoidance of double counting towards mitigation obligations: Measures must be in place to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming such as could occur by claims from both an airline and the host country of the emissions reduction activity.

Monitoring, reporting and verification: Emissions reduction is calculated in a conservative and transparent manner, verified by an accredited independent entity prior to issuance of offset credits, which should be based on accurate measurements and monitored on a regular basis.

Public disclosure of sustainable development: A programme should list the criteria used regarding alignment with the SDGs.

The selected programmes performed differently, and none perfectly against all EUCs, the TAB recommendations and expert submissions reveal. TAB underscores that various programmes “made substantial progress” towards addressing certain shortcomings, or have “indicated willingness to put in place measures to ensure consistency with the EUCs.” Still, experts proposed that programmes be approved only provisionally until they satisfy all EUCs, to avoid risks for CORSIA’s integrity. Experts also called on ICAO to provide further clarity on which global warming potential values the programmes should use when issuing CORSIA eligible offset credits.

The January 2020 report from TAB recommends that the Council request from most of the eligible carbon-offsetting programs further specified actions following its decision, with the exception of the CDM. This is because the future of registered CDM activities is still being negotiated in the context of the rules, modalities, procedures, and guidelines for Article 6 (cooperative approaches) of the Paris Agreement on climate change. International guidance on the transition of the CDM is needed since all participating Paris Agreement parties will have to correspondingly adjust their emission levels and targets upon transfer of mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting.

On using carbon offset credits under CORSIA, experts hope that Paris Agreement parties will provide clarity on:

How emission reductions not covered by Parties’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) should be treated;

What key elements are necessary for letters of attestation and authorization by host countries to confirm avoidance of double counting so the units can be used under CORSIA;

How additionality of activities can be proven; and

What actions should trigger corresponding adjustments to account for the use of offset credits under CORSIA.

The ICAO Council also improved its environmental standards to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health. Environmental and health impact assessments of aircraft engine emissions rely on Particulate Matter (PM) characteristics such as number, size, and composition, but reported PM emissions data varied due to different sampling protocols and methodologies used. For emission certification purposes, measurement methodologies needed to be standardized. Engine manufacturers use certification of aircraft engines for non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions.

At its March 2020 meeting, the ICAO Council adopted a “non-volatile PM (nvPM) mass and number Standard” for aircraft engines. The standard applies to engine designs of rated thrust greater than 26.7 Kilonewton and will govern both new and in-production engines from 2023 onwards. ICAO aims to ensure that only the most effective nvPM reduction technologies are employed in post-2023 aircraft engine designs.","The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase.

The 15-member Panel is convened to help address the financing gap for implementing the SDGs by 2030.

FACTI was first announced in late January 2020.

The Panel will present an interim report during ECOSOC’s High-level Segment in July 2020.

After the September 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development held at UN Headquarters as part of the UNGA’s high-level week, the Assembly’s Second Committee (Economic and Financial) developed a resolution that:

acknowledges that combating illicit financial flows contributes to domestic resource mobilization;

calls upon the relevant organizations of the UN system, within their respective mandates and resources, to continue their consideration of the negative impact of illicit financial flows on financing the 2030 Agenda, to further explore policy responses to the phenomenon and to coordinate their efforts in this regard; and

invites the President of the UNGA, the President of ECOSOC and the UN Secretary-General to give appropriate consideration to the importance of combating illicit financial flows and strengthening good practices on assets return to foster sustainable development, and in this regard invites all relevant international institutions to support these efforts, in accordance with their respective mandates.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande addressed the launch of the Panel, held in New York, US, on 2 March 2020. He explained that illicit financial flows and related problems threaten least developed countries’ ability to deliver adequate health care and education and threaten the achievement of the SDGs. He also noted that having entered the Decade of Action and Delivery, the UN must focus on implementing the 2030 Agenda, and the Panel will help make global economic and financial systems to “work better for everyone, everywhere.” In particular, the Panel’s independent review of existing institutional and legal frameworks related to financial accountability, transparency and integrity can identify gaps, impediments and vulnerabilities in their design and implementation, including with regard to their comprehensiveness, effectiveness and universality.

The Panel’s first meeting is tentatively scheduled for 30 March-1 April 2020, in Oslo, Norway. The panel will produce an interim report in July 2020, for presentation during ECOSOC’s High-level Segment. Following additional consultations a final report with recommendations will be submitted in February 2021.

The briefing was hosted by the UK, which will be assuming the COP 26 presidency in partnership with Italy.



COP 26 is scheduled to convene from 9-20 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK.

In his remarks on 6 March 2020, Guterres said limiting warming to 1.5°C requires that strategies be drawn up during 2020 in order to achieve emission reductions of 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The largest emitters must develop strategies to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Guterres said.

He highlighted four priorities for COP 26:

New nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that show increased ambition, and set clear targets for 2025 or 2030 to keep temperature rise to 1.5°C;

Ensuring that all countries, particularly the largest emitters, get on board to develop strategies to reach net‑zero emissions by 2050;

Adopting a robust package of programmes, projects, and initiatives to help adapt to climate disruption and build resilience against future impacts; and

Mobilization by developed countries of USD 100 billion per year by 2020 through both public and private investments.

Guterres said his Special Envoy on Climate Action and Climate Finance, Mark Carney, will engage with finance leaders on carbon neutrality, carbon pricing, climate risk disclosure, scaling up green financial instruments, embedding climate into economic and financial priorities, and enhancing NDCs. He noted the need to transform how the financial sector works, including increased investments in renewables and green technologies and ending fossil fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon, and halting the construction of new coal power plants. He urged “bottom up” ambition that depends on all partners and actors, including cities, the private sector, finance institutions, the philanthropic community, and civil society committing to meaningful climate action.

Finally, the Secretary-General acknowledged increased difficulties in the lead-up to COP 26 due to the postponement of many meetings as a result of the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak.

Incoming COP 26 President Alok Sharma, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK, said the upcoming COP is an opportunity to accelerate a fair and inclusive transition, and to agree on a package to advance the Paris Agreement. Sharma highlighted a number of areas requiring particular attention, namely:

Adaptation and resilience, and access to adaptation finance;

Safeguarding ecosystems, protecting natural habitats, environmental regulation around supply chains, channeling finance to invest in nature, and ensuring global climate and biodiversity processes complement and support each other;

Opportunities of cheaper renewables and storage, investing in innovation to help the transition to clean energy, and helping developing countries leapfrog to cleaner technologies;

Accelerating the transition to zero carbon road transport by bringing forward the date when zero emission vehicles will be cheaper and cleaner; and

Unleashing finance to power the shift to a zero-carbon economy, with USD 7 trillion needed up to 2030 to achieve the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.

Sharma also pointed to the launch of the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda, in which private finance is increasingly focused on the opportunities and risks of transitioning to a decarbonized economy, and committed to climate-related financial disclosure.

Mariangela Zappia, Permanent Representative of Italy, reiterated calls to increase ambition by: enhancing NDCs and setting clear timelines for achieving climate neutrality; increasing capacity to deal with the consequences of climate change, especially for the most vulnerable; and promoting a shift towards financial strategies and investments consistent with the Paris Agreement, among both public and private decision-makers.

Zappia said that in addition to co-hosting the Pre-COP in October 2020 in Milan, Italy, the government also will convene Youth4Climate2020 from 28-30 September, as well as a high-level ministerial event on environmental and climate challenges in Africa, taking place from 20-21 October, in Rome.

Belize, speaking for the small island developing States (SIDS), lamented that the UNFCCC process has become clouded with mistrust and disunity, and said ambitious NDCs are necessary to reverse this trend. Stressing environmental integrity, she said that new rules and guidance on markets must deliver real emission reductions, go beyond the narrative of offsetting, and not just be a “grandiose accounting scheme.” She also highlighted the need for: a robust transparency mechanism; long-term adaptation for SIDS, which is intrinsically linked to the new finance goal; and addressing governance of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) prior to COP 26. She said Belize will host an Ambition Forum from 20-21 April 2020.

France stressed that COP 26 must demonstrate increased ambition in NDCs and long-term strategies (LTS), and said major emitters must commit to a zero-emissions trajectory. In addition, France supported putting nature at the center of COP 26, and underlined: meeting financial commitments to ensure a just transition for all; reaffirming confidence in the multilateral system; and solidarity with the most vulnerable countries.

The EU urged engaging as much as possible before COP 26 to avoid “unnecessary combustion in Glasgow.” He highlighted EU efforts, including a climate law proposal that will enshrine in binding legislation the 2050 climate neutrality target, and initiatives on industrial policy, biodiversity strategy, and a strategy for sustainable food systems.

It followed on the heels of the 33rd African Union (AU) Summit, which focused on the 2020 theme, ‘Silencing the Guns: Creating conducive conditions for Africa’s Development.’

Addressing the overarching theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ the sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD 2020), was also the first regional consultation to take place under the UN@75 reform process. On the margins of the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General (UNDSG) Amina Mohammed convened several consultations with regional stakeholders, including UN and AU institutions, and youth, to elicit perspectives from on the ongoing UN reform process.

ARFSD 2020 took place from 24-27 February 2020, in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. It was co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the AU Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN system. It brought together nearly 3,000 delegates in plenary and parallel sessions over the four days, holding more than 60 preparatory and side events.

The Regional Forum assessed Africa’s progress on all 17 SDGs, clustered around the “five Ps” of the 2030 Agenda: people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnerships. Drawing on regional data sources – including the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2020, and the inaugural AU Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063 – there was a convergence of evidence that, despite some pockets of progress, the region is off track on both global and regional goals.

Forum participants engaged in in-depth discussion of key findings and lessons from a selection of VNRs currently being conducted by 17 African countries for presentation at the HLPF in July 2020, as well as emerging lessons from voluntary local reviews (VLRs), which featured for the first time at the Forum. A recurring theme in the discussions was the need to address weak national and local capacity in accessing and using quality and relevant data. Underscoring the importance of building VNRs on evidence-based local reviews, the Forum proposed developing a template to support country reporting. Accelerators for delivering a transformed and prosperous Africa, including through leveraging science, technology and innovation (STI), and strengthening partnerships with the UN Development System, major groups, youth, and other stakeholders were also highlighted.

The Forum adopted a ministerial declaration, titled, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ as well as an outcome summary report and key messages containing Africa’s priorities and policy measures to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

Addressing the negative impact of the climate crisis, Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), cited estimates that some countries are spending the equivalent of 2-3% of their GDP on unplanned responses to weather and climate impacts. Touching on repercussions for the water, energy, conflict, food security, and hydropower production sectors, she highlighted efforts underway to craft a common regional position on this issue for the 2020 UN Climate Conference.

During the 33rd AU Summit, which took place from 8-9 February, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the AU-UN strategic partnership is growing “ever stronger and more dynamic,” and highlighted interlinkages between the ‘Silencing the Guns’ initiative with targets on human rights, gender equality, climate change, and sustainable development. With an estimated tripling of armed conflicts over the past decade, despite implementation of a peace and security roadmap, the discussions underscored the importance of good governance, and building more inclusive societies.

Incoming AU Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined regional priorities to achieve the Agenda 2063, including, supporting regional integration, industrialization, and trade and investment, and strengthening women’s economic empowerment, in line with the launch of the AU Decade of Financial Inclusion for Women. The Summit adopted enhanced commitments towards this end, including plans to allocate 25% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, and the launch of the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF), which aims to provide capital to both first time and experienced fund managers, to invest in majority female-owned businesses.

Stakeholders highlighted civil society priorities for the declaration as well as plans for the UN75 People’s Forum in April 2020.

The briefing for stakeholders on 28 February 2020 was hosted by the NGO Committee on Sustainable Development-New York in collaboration with the UN2020 initiative and Together First.

The co-facilitators, Alya Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, held the first informal consultation meeting with UN Member States at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 21 February 2020, as reported in this SDG Knowledge Hub story. On Member States’ priorities for the declaration, the co-facilitators reported that:

Governments support a declaration that is both short and unifying, as well as substantive;

The discussion indicated much convergence on key issues to address in the text, with climate change and biodiversity high on the agenda;

Delegations issued calls for reforms not only of the UN Security Council but also the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); and

The importance of partnerships and the role of the private sector were emphasized during the consultation.

The co-facilitators also said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes the declaration will call for continued dialogue after the anniversary event – to be led by Member States, the Secretary-General, or an independent commission. The co-facilitators urged NGOs to reach out to Member States and groupings to ensure the adoption of a strong political declaration.

As next steps in drafting the declaration, the co-facilitators said they will present an elements paper for discussion at a consultation in early April. A zero draft will be released in May.

Providing input to the co-facilitators, stakeholders said important issues include climate change, species loss, shrinking space for civil society, and peace and disarmament. They noted that corruption is an important part of Agenda 2030 that integrates the three pillars of the UN. They suggested that the UN75 declaration and the outcome text of high-level meetings on Beijing+25 (taking place in March and September 2020) should support and reinforce each other. Participants urged the co-facilitators to find ways to include the perspectives of people who are not able to travel to the UN, and said civil society participation must be meaningful, not “ceremonial.”

Alongside the political declaration, a civil society declaration is also being developed. The UN2020 network has called for inputs, and the zero draft is available for commentary until 15 March. The declaration is expected to be adopted during the UN75 People’s Forum convening in New York, US, from 23-24 April 2020.

The People’s Forum, being coordinated by UN2020 and Together First, will focus on the theme of advancing people-centered multilateralism. In addition to the People’s Declaration, it is also expected to result in a People’s Plan for Global Action.

In the meantime, a UNGA youth plenary will take place on 31 March 2020 as part of UN75 consultations. It is scheduled back-to-back with ECOSOC’s 2020 Youth Forum which will meet from 1-2 April 2020.

The 2020 Future Policy Award aims to raise global awareness about and highlight exemplary laws, policies and legal frameworks that minimize the adverse effects of exposure to chemicals, and strengthen their sustainable management across the lifecycle. WFC is especially interested in policies from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, given the rapid increase in chemicals consumption and production in those countries.

Nominations can cover comprehensive chemical policies, as well as specific policies on, inter alia: chemicals in plastic products; highly hazardous pesticides; lead in paint; hazardous and child labor; and environmentally persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. The laws, policies, and frameworks can be national, subnational, regional, or local. They must: be in existence for a minimum of two or three years to demonstrate effective implementation and impact; deliver tangible improvements; be replicable under similar circumstances; and consider systemic aspects.

Nominations must be submitted by 31 March 2020. Winners will be honored during a high-level award ceremony during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), scheduled to convene in Bonn, Germany, from 5-9 October 2020.

2020 is a critical year for chemicals as the mandate is set to expire for the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), which was adopted in 2006 to promote chemical safety, with the goal of ensuring that, by 2020, chemicals are produced and used in ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on the environment and human health. Governments have launched a process to prepare recommendations regarding SAICM and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020. In addition, chemicals and waste management is critical for achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).

The WFC is working on the 2020 Future Policy Award process in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), SAICM, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), with support from the Government of Germany.

The study identifies several layers of convergence between the two Conventions.

Titled, ‘Land Degradation Neutrality for Biodiversity Conservation: How Healthy Land Safeguards Nature,’ the study highlights synergies linked to both Conventions’ focus on: halting the loss of natural ecosystems, especially forests; the sustainable management of land and natural capital; and protecting the livelihoods of the most affected and vulnerable communities through ensuring their fair access to natural resources, and their sustainable management. The discussion builds on lessons learned so far from implementing voluntary land degradation neutrality (LDN) targets that have been set by more than 120 countries, and the CBD National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs).

Underscoring that the bulk of the CBD’s 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be met, the report makes the case for joint, and scaled up action, by observing that land degradation and biodiversity loss are among the most pressing environmental challenges facing humanity. Citing data from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report notes that land degradation has reduced the productivity of nearly one-quarter of the global land surface, impacted the well-being of about 3.2 billion people and costing approximately 10% of annual global gross domestic product in lost ecosystem services. The report also highlights links to the third Rio Convention — the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — notably an IPBES conclusion that one-third of the solution to the climate crisis can be found through restoration, conservation and other land management action.

The report draws on country case studies showcasing “LDN in action for biodiversity,” from Benin, Chile, Jamaica, Moldova, Namibia, and the Philippines, to explore how coordinated implementation can simultaneously address the drivers of land degradation and biodiversity loss, while protecting ecosystems, and supporting climate action.

The report identifies the ongoing negotiations for a post-2020 biodiversity framework, as well as the commencement of the 2021-2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, as important opportunities for achieving greater synergies in programme design, financing, and implementation of the Rio Conventions. It calls for the design and implementation of ‘LDN Transformative Projects and Programmes’ that, inter alia, contribute to multiple SDGs, involve all relevant stakeholders, consider gender issues, and reflect a balance between the different social, economic and environmental priorities and interests at stake.

The report concludes with a number recommendations addressed to various stakeholders at different levels, including:

In order to achieve ambitious global goals, parties to international agreements, including the UNCCD and the CBD, should develop their instruments, objectives, and programmes in ways that recognize and take advantage of their many co-benefits and synergies.

As the process of defining the post-2020 global biodiversity framework moves forward, country parties should recognize and harness the potential that LDN and area-based targets offer to address the priorities of both the CBD and the UNCCD in an effective, complementary and mutually supporting manner.

International organizations should strengthen the technical and capacity-building support provided to governments and other LDN stakeholders to help maintain the strong momentum created to date and optimize LDN’s contributions to biodiversity conservation goals.

Governments should continue to strengthen coordination among ministries and departments with areas of authority relevant to LDN and biodiversity to ensure that policies and strategies build on the synergies and savings available through integrated planning and prioritize prevention.

Financial support for governance and capacity building should be used to enhance the ability of countries to craft policies and programmes for LDN, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable use and other national priorities that have wide stakeholder support and promote integrated planning and action.

The study is one of the actions taken by the Global Mechanism (GM) of the UNCCD in response to an evaluation of the LDN Target Setting Programme in April 2019, which called for increased knowledge sharing on LDN target setting and implementation. The GM has undertaken a series of complementary studies on other thematic areas, including: forest and landscape restoration, poverty and inequality, food insecurity in mountain regions, and gender equality.

Further studies are under development focusing on how LDN targets contribute to the sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable agriculture and food security, water security, and land-use planning.

Landsvirkjun has signed an agreement with US and UK institutional investors to issue USD 80 million senior unsecured notes in the US Private Placement (“USPP”) market. The issue reiterates Landsvirkjun’s focus on sustainability-linked financing, linking the pricing of the notes to the company’s carbon sequestration targets, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 13 on climate action.

The offering was very well received, with an order book which was multiple times oversubscribed. The attractiveness of this funding opportunity was enhanced by the ability of the US and UK investors to provide short-dated notes in a favourable rate environment. The notes have a 3-year maturity and carry a fixed interest rate of 2.51%, with semi-annual payments. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

The issuance demonstrates Landsvirkjun’s continued commitment and focus on sustainable development and follows the execution of a USD 150 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2019 and the successful placing of a USD 200 million green bond in the USPP market in 2018.





First European SDG-linked USPP

Landsvirkjun is the first issuer in Europe of an SDG-linked USPP. The USPP is understood to be one of the first SDG-linked issuances in Europe overall and underscores Landsvirkjun’s innovation and leadership in this fast-moving space.

As part of the transaction, Landsvirkjun has committed to increase its carbon sequestration efforts to reach at least 32,538 tons of CO 2 eq. for 2020 (up by at least 2% from 31,900 tons CO 2 eq. for 2019). The USPP is directly tied to this commitment whereas the annual coupon will increase by 10 bps if Landsvirkjun fails to achieve this target. The target forms part of Landsvirkjun’s strategy to become carbon neutral by 2025.

Barclays acted as Sole Placement Agent in this transaction. Landsvirkjun’s legal advisors were Logos and Morrison & Foerster. The funders’ legal advisor was Greenberg Traurig.





Hörður Arnarson, CEO of Landsvirkjun:

“We are pleased with our second successful issuance in the USPP market and the support that we have received from our investor group. The private placement provides further diversification of funding sources and demonstrates our ability to access financing on attractive terms. As sustainability and the environment are core to our social responsibility initiatives, we are proud to have issued the first SDG-linked USPP in Europe, which further reinforces our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.”





Landsvirkjun

Landsvirkjun is owned by the Icelandic State. The company generates about 75% of all electricity used in Iceland from 100% renewable energy sources, hydro, geothermal and wind. The company operates eighteen power stations; fifteen hydropower stations and three geothermal power stations, as well as two wind turbines.

The VNRs are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its 17 SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) each year in July.

The panel discussion took place on 10 March 2020, as part of the TAP-UNDP initiative to create a resource for stakeholders involved in post-VNR activities on SDG 16. The resource is expected to be published later in 2020.

Mechanisms established for a country’s VNR process should continue their work following the presentation.

Joern Geisselmann, Partners for Review (P4R), identified trends and country experiences following a VNR presentation. Among the lessons learned, he said VNRs should not only review past implementation, but also agree on next steps. Immediate action should be taken after the VNR as a follow-up step, such as reporting to parliament and/or the media. Geisselmann also suggested institutionalizing any mechanisms established for the VNR process, to continue their work following the presentation to the HLPF.

He reported that in some countries that have conducted VNRs, follow-up activities have included:

Georgia introduced an SDG architecture, including a multi-stakeholder SDG Council, thematic working groups and an Annual Forum to share and debate experiences related to SDG implementation;

Germany established an annual Sustainability Forum as a multi-stakeholder dialogue forum organized by the Chancellery;

Mexico involved the Ministry of Finance in a process to map all applicable budget lines and programs with SDG indicators; and

Mongolia conducted a systems analysis of drivers, bottlenecks and impacts, and developed short- and long-term actions to tackle air pollution.

Margarita Cano of SEGEPLAN, Guatemala’s State planning body (Secretaría de Planificación y Programación de la Presidencia), discussed her country’s efforts to mainstream and implement SDG 16 and the 2030 Agenda following its first VNR in 2017 and second in 2019. She reported that after the 2017 presentation, the government changed its approach from government-led to whole-of-society, engaging local governments, civil society organizations, the private sector and congress. This enabled the government to collect far more usable data than it had in 2017.

Following its 2019 VNR, the ministry incorporated the results of the review as it developed goals for the next four years.

Peter van Sluijs, Civil Society Platform for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (CSPPS), said the VNRs have been “seen as an end product” rather that a means to determine actions needed for further results. He observed that, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries, if a country does not fully utilize its consultative processes to develop its view of progress, the VNR is not being used as a management tool for steering the 2030 Agenda at the national level. He called for meaningful stakeholder inclusion and participation in the follow-up processes to the VNRs.

In February 2020, CSPPS released a publication titled, ‘Reporting for the Future,’ as a report of its Ready for Review project. The report includes an in-depth analysis of implementation and lessons learned that will inform the next stage of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in fragile and conflict-affected countries, and better support the countries that will present VNRs in 2020.

Ameyovi Alice Goza, Founder and President of the International Association of Women and Young Leaders (AIFJL) in Togo, highlighted the importance of engaging young people in post-VNR processes, stressing that youth groups continually achieve positive impacts on the ground. She called for capacity building for the efforts of youth organizations.

Fiona Dawe, UK Office of National Statistics (ONS), reported that since the UK’s VNR in 2019, the ONS is working to make the country’s SDG data more readily accessible to the its government and other interested stakeholders. She explained that the Open SDG National Reporting Platform is a free-to-reuse, open-source SDG reporting and monitoring solution, with completely customizable software. It was developed in collaboration with the US Government and the Center for Open Data for Enterprise. The UK is providing technical support to other countries’ national statistical offices as well as other stakeholders, to create their own platforms for SDG data. To date, approximately 13 countries have replicated the site for their own contexts or are working to do so.

Since 2016, 158 VNRs have been presented by 142 countries at the Forum. In 2020, the following 51 countries are preparing VNRs: first-time presenters – Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; second-time presenters – Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe; and third-time presenter Benin.

Once the regulations are concluded, they will govern future activities in the Area. Negotiators are striving to ensure the regulations provide environmental protection while balancing stakeholders’ interests.

During the ISA-26 talks, which took place from 17-21 February 2020, in Kingston, Jamaica, delegates also engaged in discussions over new proposals on regional environmental management plans (REMPs), which ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge described as “one of the most important work streams of the ISA over the last two years.” Furthermore, they discussed the financial model for mineral exploitation in the Area, agreeing to convene a fourth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) to further this work.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the meeting notes that delegates were reminded that the self-imposed deadline for completing the exploitation regulations is 2020, which has put the ISA Council “under pressure to agree on a mining code. Further, while the commercial viability of exploitation of minerals from the deep sea depends on many factors, from technology to mineral prices, contractors and sponsoring states are eager for the clarity that a regulatory code would provide.” At the same time, some members and observers have stressed the need for marine scientific research and adequate stakeholder engagement, to ensure environmental protection and conservation.

The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators from across all 17 Goals.

The UNECE Dashboard for SDGs was launched on 13 March 2020, ahead of UNECE’s Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFSD will only convene for a half-day, online meeting on 19 March 2020.

Data disaggregation remains a major gap in monitoring the SDGs.

The Dashboard draws on data from the UN Global SDG Database. The 80 indicators included in the dashboard are listed at the indicator menu page.

The Dashboard allows users to:

See “snapshots” by country, and compare countries;

View differences between women and men;

Create graphs and maps; and

Access definitions and explanations.

Users can download full datasets for more in-depth analysis.

Announcing the launch of the Dashboard, UNECE notes that a major gap in monitoring the SDGs is data disaggregation. Although the 2030 Agenda calls for examining indicators for specific population groups – broken up by sex, age, ethnicity, as well as migratory, disability and/or indigenous status – data collection still must be significantly increased to make this possible. UNECE reports that “to date, the only disaggregation offered in the UNECE dashboard is by sex, where possible with the currently-available data.”

UNECE adds that it is working to improve measurement in areas of the SDGs that are particularly hard to measure, including disaggregated poverty measurement, migration statistics, environmental statistics and indicators, climate change-related statistics, and statistics on children and youth.

As was decided at the previous Board meeting, the Co-Chairs presented a draft of the updated workplan of the Board for 2020–2023, including a schedule for a list of items the Board will consider in 2020. The Board considered a draft decision to adopt the updated workplan, which built on previous discussions that were held at an informal meeting from 5-7 February 2020, in Monrovia, Liberia.

Board members requested prioritizing: by June 2020, the approval of key policies related to the investment framework, including the incremental and full cost methodology, the policy on ‘concessionality’ and the mapping on eligibility and selection criteria; and by 2021, the approval of guidelines on the Board decisions without a Board meeting.

In informal consultations, views diverged on: strategic objectives and allocations; shifting financial flows; project prioritization; diversifying instruments; accreditation prioritization; and efficient process management and delegation. The Board advanced convergence of views on diversifying instruments and accreditation prioritization, but concluded with the need to further discuss the workplan at its June session.

The Board also took note of actions to be undertaken in 2020 in response to the guidance received from parties during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) in 2019.

Working towards enhancing the effectiveness of committees

The status of the review of the effectiveness of committees was also highlighted as critical to be addressed as soon as possible under the GCF’s work plan. A previous report, which was distributed on a limited basis, suggested that there was scope to improve transparency by reviewing record keeping and reporting to the Board, and enhance effectiveness by reviewing structures of committees as well as the way committees operate and coordinate.

The Board took note of the ‘Final report of the review of the effectiveness of committees and groups established by the Board’ and of the ‘General Guidelines for Committees and Panels,’ and requested the Co-Chairs to consultant with members and Committees and present updated guidelines by its next June session.

Improving the GCF’s Simplified Approval Process

The Board also considered the review of the simplified approval process pilot scheme, which assesses the results achieved by the simplified approval process (SAP) to date, and includes recommendations for streamlining and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAP. The review found the following:

The SAP is a valuable funding modality that can lead to expeditious approval of low-risk projects that can better address the urgent climate adaptation needs of GCF priority countries, such as the African States, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small islands developing States (SIDS);

The SAP pipeline has grown by an average of 10.5% every month and represented 22% of all submission in the GCF pipeline, demonstrating a strong demand for SAP, especially from direct access entities (DAEs) which compose the majority of pipeline submissions; and

Despite the fact that SAP projects are small in terms of GCF finance and have low risks, the SAP is perceived similar to the regular proposal approval process even if they involve funding proposals that imply higher risks and require much larger amounts of GCF finance.

The review’s main recommendations include:

expand to activities that imply limited environmental and social risks;

speed up the approval cycle of such projects and programmes with ‘In between Board Meeting’ approvals;

introduce delegated authority to the Secretariat for the approval of SAP projects and programmes that imply minimal to no environmental and social risks;

use dedicated independent expert consultants in lieu of the independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP);

increase the Secretariat’s capacity for technical reviews of a larger number of SAP proposals using external technical reviewers;

strengthen technical support to DAEs with closer alignment to Project Preparation Facility and Readiness activities; and

keep expanding the knowledge products on SAP, which build the capacity of accredited entities and national designated authority in SAP project design/development.

Some members signaled their: opposition to delegating authority or functions of the ITAP to external consultants; concern over the unbalanced geographically distribution of projects in the SAP pipeline; and opposition to introducing any notion of “GCF priority countries.”

Observers called for ensuring that any ‘In between Board Meeting’ approval process allows for stakeholder input, and opposed the use of the SAP to facilitate private sector involvement as well as an opening up of the SAP for any projects outside of activities with minimal or no adverse environmental or social risks or impacts. The Board requested the Secretariat to further develop the SAP for Board consideration by its next meeting.

Increasing ITAP’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals

As ITAP is one of the areas identified in the SAP review in which efficiency could be increased both under the SAP and the regular GCF proposal approval process, the Board considered an option to enhance the ITAP by increasing its members to ensure that more projects will be brought before the Board for approval.

GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec clarified, among others, that the GCF’s key challenges include an increased need for project review, with an expected increase in the number of projects per year based on the level of replenishment. He said that 52 projects are currently undergoing review and noted that the GCF is on track to submit 21 projects to ITAP for the Board’s next meeting. He added that a larger number is expected for the Board’s subsequent meeting, in part to deliver on the ambition for UNFCCC COP 26.

During discussions, members raised procedural questions and advocated establishing a roster of experts. Observers stressed the importance to engage in more detail with in-country project relevant stakeholders and affected people. The Board decided to, inter alia:

re-appoint three members of the ITAP for a 1.5- year term;

increase the size of the ITAP from six to ten members by the end of 2020;

approve an additional administrative budget for the Board for the year 2020 in the amount of USD 338,800, to cover the additional four members of ITAP, the administrative support consultant, and the operationalization of the roster of experts; and

request the Secretariat, in consultation with the Investment Committee and the ITAP, to propose updates to the operational modalities of ITAP to accommodate the increased workload by the next Board meeting.

Status of the GCF’s financial resources

The GCF saw USD 10.3 billion in contributions during the fund’s initial resource mobilization which lasted from 2015-2018, and USD 9.8 billion for the GCF’s 2020-2023 replenishment, or first replenishment (GCF-1), with a combined total of USD 8.3 billion received so far. At its March meeting, the Board took note of the Status of GCF resources, pipelines and portfolio performance.

The GCF resource status shows that the total of GCF funding commitments amounts to USD 6.5 billion, which is composed of: USD 5.4 billion under approved projects; USD 0.3 billion under Readiness and Project Preparation Facilities; and, taking other factors into account, a remaining commitment authority of USD 1.8 billion. Noteworthy, USD 13.9 billion of co-financing mobilized, in addition to the 5.4 billion GCF financing, serve the approved projects and activities in 105 countries.

The largest portion of GCF Funding, amounting to USD 2.2 billion, is allocated to 37 countries in the African Region. This geographical distribution is followed by: USD 1.9 billion allocated to 34 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and USD 1.1 billion allocated to 27 countries from Latin and Caribbean Region. About USD 1.4 billion has been committed to 23 LDCs and USD 0.8 billion to SIDS.

The GCF portfolio of approved projects is expected to abate a total of 1.6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (GHG) in carbon dioxide equivalent and reach 348 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries, based on the estimations of accredited entities. Since November 2015, the Board approved 124 funding proposals, with 74 projects under implementation and 61 projects receiving funds. In total, the approved projects, including co-financing, amount to USD 20.6 billion.

By the start of the year the GCF Funding pipeline showed 79 public and private sector funding proposals, which request a total GCF funding of USD 3.4 billion to support projects and programmes totaling USD 11.8 billion, when taking co-financing into account.

During discussions, members raised concerns about projects that are not progressing over long periods of time, suggesting consideration to restructure such projects and implement early filters as remedy measures. The Secretariat informed that it was developing a stronger portfolio performance management system to identify early warning and project performance and reported that seven projects worth USD 500 million “were stuck for two years” but are now expected to move towards implementation by mid-2020.

Progress on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD+

Regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the Board took note of the Secretariat’s analysis of the experience with, and the progress made towards, achieving the objectives of the pilot programme for REDD-plus results-based payments. Findings include:

a positive response from REDD+ countries, and that the numbers of countries submitting REDD+ results to the UNFCCC increased from three to 12 in the last two years;

procedures approved by the Board are fully functional, and that technical capacities were enhanced in ITAP with UNFCCC experts; and

the pilot is relevant to the REDD+ results-based payments finance landscape, given that the GCF has provided 30% out of the global volume of this finance and a large interest to continue and to explore options, including involving the private sector to leverage additional finance for the pilot programme.

So far four projects in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and Paraguay for USD 228.63 million have been approved, with six projects in the pipeline from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Nine more are expected by the end of the pilot programme, seven from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and three from the Asian region, while the funds are likely to be exhausted by 2021 and prior to the end of the pilot programme in 2022.

Recommendations from the analysis include, given the complexity of REDD+ elements, to further discuss and analyze alternatives for the continuation of the implementation of REDD+ results-based payments, including:

analyzing market and non-market contexts, the role of the private sector, complementarity with other multi- and bilateral funding arrangements, and technical and procedural matters; and

considering options such as to extend the pilot programme, a second pilot programme with some adjustments, a permanent funding window, and a grandparenting period.

Noting diverging views on REDD+ in general, some members highlighted that ensuring environmental integrity is a key issue to take into account when addressing the future for the pilot programme. Members also: voiced their reservations about considering a permanent funding window; supported consideration of the role of private actors; and cautioned against prejudging ongoing negotiations under Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches). Raising concerns about the four funding proposals already adopted, Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples: called for revisions of the pilot programme; opposed the use of reference levels that lower ambition; raised questions about carbon storage permanence and verification of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and stressed the need to avoid double counting.

Board approves USD 169.7 million in GCF funding for six projects and programmes

The GCF Board approved six funding proposals amounting to USD 169.7 million in GCF funding that will support projects and programmes with a total value of USD 618.7 million. The majority of the funding, or 74%, is allocated for adaptation projects, and 26% for mitigation projects. The expected impact potential is to abate a total of 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) of GHGs and reach 4.8 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries. Specifically, the GCF approved finance to support four public-sector projects in the following countries:

Viet Nam, with a USD 30.2 million GCF grant for a USD 156.3 million adaptation project which aims to empower vulnerable smallholders by securing water provision, supporting farmers to adopt climate-resilient agriculture, and strengthening access to agro-climate information, credit and markets.

Zimbabwe, with a USD 26.6 million GCF grant for a USD 47.8million adaptation project which seeks to address climate impacts and build the resilience of smallholder farmers in three semi-arid agroecological regions of southern Zimbabwe.

Sri Lanka, with a USD 39.8 million GCF grant for a USD 49 million adaptation project which aims to strengthen the capacity of smallholder subsistence farmers to address climate-induced irrigation and drinking water shortages by improving the resilience of farm- and land-management practices, and by climate proofing ecosystems.

Cuba, with a USD 38.3 million GCF grant for a USD 119.9 million cross-cutting project which seeks to increase the climate resilience of agricultural production and ensure food security through improved ecosystem services from agroforestry, silvopastoral systems, reforestation and assisted natural forest regeneration in seven municipalities vulnerable to climate change.

The Board also approved two private sector funding proposals for climate action in the following countries:

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are benefiting from GCF funding of USD 25 million in equity for a USD 200 million mitigation programme, titled ‘Arbaro Fund – Sustainable Forestry Fund.’ It will invest in sustainable plantation forestry projects with adaptation co-benefits to increase carbon sinks by producing wood in a sustainable manner and conserving natural forests, whilst contributing to reduction of illegal logging.

Haiti, with a USD 1.5 million GCF grant and a USD 8.4 million loan for a USD 45.7 million cross-cutting project. The project aims to: develop 22 community-scale solar plus battery storage micro-grids in communities where currently no grid power exists; provide affordable and reliable access to modern energy services in communities; and build capacity for microgrid deployment and operation.

The Board further:

took note of the explanation provided by the Secretariat and the Accreditation Panel regarding the accreditation of the applicant ‘National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development’; and

transferred to the Board for approval, without Board meeting and on a no objection basis, of the two applicants ‘Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation’ and ‘Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia’.

In addition, the GCF also considered a number of reports during its meeting, including on the activities of the Secretariat, Board committees and independent units, and by the Co-Chairs such as proposals on Board decisions without a Board meeting, and their proposal on the review of committees, panels and groups.

The GCF Board Meeting closed without a decision on the date and venue of its next meeting, but with the understanding that the previous decision on the date, from 23-25 June 2020, stands unless the Board revokes that decision.

Given the extraordinary circumstances regarding the COVID-19 virus outbreak, the Board considered: authorizing the Co-Chairs to determine whether to change the venue, or hold the meeting by way of video conference, teleconference or net meeting; and requesting the Co-Chairs to continue to monitor the developments and consult with the Board on a possible change in date and/or venue for its next meeting. Observing no consensus, the Co-Chairs proposed further in-between meeting consultations.","This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

Along with the NISSAP, an outline for a Proposed Eradication of Feral Cats from Malden Island and Guidelines for Monitoring Birds and Invasive Species at Kiritimati have been developed.

The efforts to address invasive alien species outlined in these documents are important for reaching SDG Target 15.8 on introducing measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and controlling or eradicating the priority species by 2020. They also contribute to achieving Article 5.1 of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols on ensuring sound environmental management and development of natural resources.

According to the ‘Guidelines for Monitoring Birds and Invasive Species at Kiritimati, Kiribati,’ the country is home to a diverse flora and fauna, including 21 breeding sea bird species, many of which are considered globally important and two of which are under threat of extinction, in part due to invasive species, including two species of rat and feral cats. Other threats to sea birds include poaching, pollutants from commercial fishing and potential impacts of climate change on food availability and the quality of nesting areas.

The Guidelines were initially created by the Wildlife Conservation Unit in 2012 and updated in 2018, with support from conservation biologists Pierce, Brown and VanderWerf to help manage and monitor birds and invasive species on Kiritimati. These efforts are especially important for the Kiritimati populations of endangered species such as the Phoenix Petrel (Te Ruru), the White-throated Storm-Petrel (Te Bwebwe ni Marawa), and the vulnerable Christmas Island Warbler (Te Bokikokiko), with Kiritimati being the stronghold for all three of these species.

The NISSAP outlines previous successes regarding the removal of invasive species throughout Kiribati. For example, the removal of rats from two of the PIPA islands and many islets within the Kiritimati lagoon have resulted in locally improved nesting productivity and greater seabird numbers.

Despite the successes, the NISSAP notes that resources are limited, and there is a need to ensure that efforts are well-directed and effective “towards achieving a sustainable livelihood for people and environmental values.” [Publication: National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan 2015-2020] [Kiribati Environment Data Portal] [Pacific Environment Portal]

With the commitment towards compliance with the SDGs, there is a definite improvement in the data system to obtain the relevant estimates for indicators representing each of the goals. In the process of obtaining these estimates, two concerns arise: the levels of disaggregation and the reliability of the estimates conditioned by the rarity of the event or phenomenon.

In terms of an adverse indicator, like the maternal mortality rate,, the two concerns are equally relevant in the sense that with decline in this adversity, there is a compromise in its reliability. Further, its disaggregation obtains differentially reliable estimates ineligible for comparison.

A 2015 WHO study on the reduction of MMR by 75% from 1990 to 2015 in the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) suggested that, by 2013, MMR was reduced by 45%, from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births – reflecting substantial progress but still falling far short of the global MDG goals. MMR reduction is a priority in the SDGs, with the broad objective to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

Hence, it is questionable as to whether such estimates be obtained in brief periodicity (i.e. every three years) based on the same sample coverage and secondly should these estimates be compared across regions with differential reliability. The following discussion elaborates on this pressing concern to draw attention of policy makers.

The most recently released statistics on maternal mortality notes a decline of 8 units in the maternal mortality ratio in the gap of three years, which is a positive trend. The target level of SDGs for this indicator is 70 per one lakh live births by the year 2030, and this seems very much within the horizon given the declining exposure to reproduction on one hand and ever-increasing extent of institutional deliveries on the other. While this aggregate achievement seems realisable, the disturbing part of the story lies in the intra country disparities which are stark and revealing of the differential vulnerabilities across regions.

The national achievement makes a specific region 1.8 times more vulnerable vis-à-vis the other two regions 0.52 and 0.63 times-less vulnerable based on the MMR. These differences are alarming in the sense that they are not merely guided by the differential risk of reproduction alone as convergence in fertility decline across the country is a reality. Further, such a pattern could very well lead to compliance with the SDG target at the national level leaving behind some regions with such adversities. The race towards compliance with SDGs has always this limitation as one of the authors of this note observed in the initial years of SDG formulation as to whether target compliance will compromise on equities.

The three regional estimates of MMR put the southern region comprising five states at 72, a group of other six states of the north and western region at 90 against the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states with the inclusion of Assam at 175. Apart from these regional estimates, Assam leads the table with an MMR levels of 229 followed by Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar which have MMR estimates closer to 200. One would imagine that these are purely a derivative of differential exposure to reproduction but it is not the case given the decline in fertility levels across the EAG states.

There is apprehension as to such high levels of MMRs may not necessarily be associated with childbirth alone but miscarriages and non-clinical abortions as well. The levels of MMRs in EAG states are distinctly higher compared with other states except in Punjab. Another aspect of this comparison relates to the statistical reliability of these estimates. The high levels of MMR in EAG states do have the widest possible confidence intervals understandably owing to the rarity of this event. But the kind of decline that is celebrated should also take into account the wide confidence intervals as they might otherwise be a statistical construct and not a real decline at all. In that sense, the regional estimates are somewhat acceptable for comparison which presents a clear regional divide that needs focus and attention.

Another aspect of this phenomenon is to situate them in an age profile to identify age-specific vulnerabilities. Given that a larger share of fertility or childbirth related experience is below the age of 30 years, a risk evaluation indicates that almost two-thirds of maternal deaths are happening between ages 20-30 years of age. Hence, the common understanding that adolescent motherhood or high-risk age of maternity do not seem to intensify this problem. In addition, the fertility transition too places this age bracket to share a significant share of the childbirth experience. This suggests towards targeting the younger and primipara women to comply with institutional deliveries as well as the maternal care continuum to avoid such adversities.

Finally, caution needs to be exercised about certifying compliance of such targets overlooking the regional disparities as well as reliability of estimates given the rarity of the phenomenon itself. While monitoring this phenomenon is desirable, it is rather important to change focus from reducing levels to that of converging them.

The term is used to describe the selective reporting of companies’ impacts, sans failures, in regard to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

It appears to be an issue of omission and one-sided reporting, according to the Responsible Mining Foundation, an independent research organization that supports the proliferation of responsible mining, which found that many of the world’s largest mining companies have continuously failed to mention any negative impacts that might impede achievement of the SDGs, the organization said, in its recent RMI Report 2020.

The report is an “evidence-based assessment” of the economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) policies and practices of 38 large-scale mining companies, which means that its data helps paint a truly global picture — the firms operate in more than 780 mine sites, and together account for 28 percent of the world’s mining activity by value of production, according to RMI. The data was gathered throughout a one-year study, and approximately two months were spent reviewing and assessing various aspects of each company.

According to the International Labor Organization, mining remains one of the top three most hazardous sectors. RMF’s raison d’être is to support the principle that “minerals and metals mining should benefit the economies, improve the lives of peoples and respect the environments of producing countries, while allowing companies and their investors to make a fair and viable return.”

By the Numbers

Mapped to the SDGs and approximately 50 international initiatives, standards or guidelines related to responsible mining or corporate accountability, RMF’s methodology is thorough, to say the least.

RMF’s index is shaped by a specific analytical framework, comprised of six thematic areas: economic development, business conduct, lifecycle management, community well-being, working conditions and environmental responsibility. This is in addition to 76 individual indicators that were distributed among three measurement areas: commitment (follow-through on what they said they’d do), action (what they’ve done so far) and effectiveness (meaningful, measurable outcomes).

More specifically, each category includes an in-depth assessment into companies’ said “progress.” RMF explained, “Commitment indicators assess the extent to which companies have formalized their commitments on particular issues, assigned responsibilities and accountabilities for the implementation of these commitments, and provided resources and staffing to operationalize the commitments. Action indicators assess the extent to which companies have developed systematic approaches to address particular issues and disclose key aspects of their activities, and Effectiveness indicators assess the extent to which companies track, and report on, their performance in managing particular issues and demonstrate continuous improvement on these issues.”

The report also assesses 180 individual mine sites in 45 countries against 10 basic indicators of responsible mining, including local employment; local procurement; post-closure plans; community grievances; worker grievances; air quality; water quality; tailings management; and emergency preparedness.

A Red Flag

But for mining companies, “SDG-washing” is highlighting specific stats that give the impression of responsible mining, which “fails to present stakeholders with a true picture of the challenges the mining sector faces in its support of the SDGs,” according to RMF.

The disillusion surrounding the industry’s progress thus far in its quest for responsible mining has led to a “disconnect between company-wide policies and standards, versus actual on-the-ground actions at mine sites, where the impacts of mining are most evident,” RMF said, raising a huge red flag that encourages industry members to take a deeper look at companies’ claims versus reality.

Who’s Who

The list of mining companies in the report includes Anglo American; AngloGold Ashanti; Antofagasta; ArcelorMittal; Banpu; Barrick Gold Corp; BHP; Buenaventura; Bumi Resources; China Shenhua; Coal India;, Codelco; ERG; Evraz; Exxaro Resources; First Quantum Minerals; Fortescue; Freeport-McMoRan; Glencore; Gold Fields; Grupo México; Industrias Peñoles; MMG; Navoi MMC; Newcrest Mining; Newmont; NMDC; Nordgold; Orano; Peabody Energy; Polymetal; Rio Tinto; RUSAL; Sibanye-Stillwater; Teck; Vale; Vedanta Resources; and Zijin.

Hélène Piaget, chief executive officer of the Responsible Mining Foundation, said that the SDGs “provide a valuable societal framework for reporting and action on economic, social and environmental concerns, but an unbalanced emphasis on the ‘good’ that companies do may obscure the negative impacts, be they inherent or unintentional, that may impede the achievement of the SDG goals.”

Piaget added that a proactive approach toward the SDGs, in tandem with data transparency, can reap positive results for mining companies. “While the trust-deficit with society is recognized as the number-one risk for mining companies, the RMI Report 2020 acts as a prompt to the industry to eliminate the need to respond to multiple information requests. By proactively making EESG data available — starting at individual mine sites and in open data formats companies can help to build trust, limit risk, and show respect. In fact, more proactive data disclosure will reduce the demand for companies’ reporting.”

Great Expectations

Since the last RMI assessment in 2018, several large-scale mining companies have been “at the center of major controversies as mine tailings failures have claimed scores of lives, devastated whole communities and caused major environmental disasters,” RMF noted.

Afshin Mehrpouya, associate professor at HEC Paris and member of the Board of the RMF, said that “Such tragedies reflect very poorly on the sector as a whole and put into stark perspective companies’ claims of responsible mining. The industry must redouble its efforts to prove that it prioritizes broader ESG responsibilities over short-term considerations.”

And it can be done. Similar to the prior assessment, this year’s report noted that “mining can meet society’s expectations.” The RMF said “if one company were to achieve all the highest scores recorded” in each of the indicators, “it would reach more than 70 percent of the maximum achievable score.”

And similarly, the RMF said if one mine site “were to achieve all the highest scores seen for the asset-level indicators, it would score over 80 percent. All companies are encouraged to adopt more systematically the good practices already being demonstrated across the sector.”

Commitment Issues

Usually, good comes with the bad — and in the case of mining, it’s no different: The report noted a “modest overall improvement” by companies on many of the issues previously assessed in 2018. Albeit, “much of the improvement is due to companies making commitments, with markedly less evidence of progress in following up these commitments with concrete actions,” RMF said, adding that “the weakest results relate to companies’ efforts to track, review and act to improve the effectiveness of their actions on EESG issues.”

RMF explained, “So while commitments are a step in the right direction, the mining sector as a whole would benefit – both in terms of its performance and its trust-building with other stakeholders – from being able to demonstrate more consistent implementation of commitments across operational portfolios and across issues.”

The Bottom Line

And as it goes with most sustainability topics, transparency is critical — RMF said that not only was there little evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighboring communities, workers, governments and investors, the organization was hard-pressed to find evidence of companies engaging with local stakeholders on important issues, inclusive of local procurement, grievance mechanisms or air and water quality, all according to RMF.

Of the 180 individual mine sites assessed, only one site scores more than 50 percent — the other 145 sites scored less than 20 percent, and 45 sites scored zero on all 10 indicators, the report said.

All in all, it boils down to the bottom line: “None of the companies [showed] consistent performance across the mine sites they own or operate.”

Presenting the report’s highlights at UN Headquarters on 10 March 2020, Taalas said that: 2019 was the second warmest year on record and ended with a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels; 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record; and CO2 levels had reached a new peak in January and February 2020.

The report highlights the physical indicators of climate change, such as increasing land and ocean heat, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice. It also addresses the impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security, and land and marine ecosystems. It includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, international experts, scientific institutions and UN agencies, and provides information for policymakers to consider in their decision-making processes.

In his presentation, Taalas said that a recent decadal forecast from the UK’s Met Office indicates a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years, and, over 10 years, temperature estimates range from 1.1 to 1.65°C, exceeding the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. Taalas said that while developed countries have been able to decouple economic growth from emissions growth, developing countries have not yet done so.

Taalas highlighted that smoke and pollutants from the Australian wildfires reverberated across the globe, causing an increase in CO2 emissions, and record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier with significant impacts on sea level rise. He warned of a growing water crisis in parts of Africa and in Southern Asia, many areas of which depend on glaciers as the main freshwater source.

Other examples of socioeconomic impacts highlighted in the report include a deteriorating food security situation in some countries in 2019 due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict, and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people in the Horn of Africa were estimated to be severely food insecure. In addition, unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 contributed to a locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, the worst in over 25 years.

The report also addresses high-impact events, including:

floods in Southern Asia, Iran, the US, which experienced US$20 billion in losses, and South America, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion;

drought, with Australia having its driest year on record;

heatwaves, with record-breaking temperatures in Australia and Europe;

tropical cyclones in the Bahamas and along the eastern coast of Africa, increasing food insecurity and displacement; and

increased wildfire activity in high-latitude areas, such as Siberia and Alaska and even in parts of the Arctic, where such events were previously rare.

Responding to questions regarding the impacts of the coronavirus on climate change, its short-term contribution to decreased emissions, and its potential to drain resources and political will from climate efforts, Guterres said he expects the impacts of and efforts related to coronavirus to be temporary and underscored the need to ensure that efforts to fight the virus do not distract from addressing climate change. Taalas added that while the virus is negatively impacting the economy in the short term, the economic consequences of non-action on climate change over the long term would be massive.

83,https://nationvalleynews.com/2020/03/09/sdg-explains-importance-half-loads-protect-infrastructure/,"Mon, 09 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Nation Valley News,SDG explains the importance of half-loads to protect its infrastructure,"SDG — The first sign of spring in the county? It’s not the tweet of the robin. Ditto Roll Up the Rim.

Instead, it’s the ushering in of half-load season on select county and local roads. Half-load season is just that, the limiting of materials to five tonnes per axle on the weaker roads located throughout the region.



Roads that are subject to seasonal weight restrictions are identified with a sign. Half-loads will be enforced once signs are posted, which started March 6, 2020 and will likely run into the early part of May.

Except the following locations, most roads within SDG are subject to half-load restrictions:

– South of Highway 401 on County Road Nos. 1, 14, 33 and 35.

– County Road 15 from County Road 2 to the southwest leg of County Road 36.

– County Road 44 from Highway No. 138 to 840m East of County Road 42

– County Road Nos. 31, 34, 43, 46

– County Road No. 2 from Leeds & Grenville boundary to the City of Cornwall boundary and from the City of Cornwall boundary to the Ontario/Quebec boundary.

Benjamin de-Haan, the director of transportation and planning for the county, said half-load season is integral to the long-term sustainability of the road infrastructure within the county – the biggest municipal roads system in the entire province.

“We strive to ensure we allow for the transportation of goods across the county, while at the same time putting measures in place to protect the investment taxpayers have made in our infrastructure,” he said. “These kinds of measures are important to the bottom line of the county, as well as the effective use of taxpayer dollars.”

Why are these measures so important? Try to think of a road like a giant sandwich buried in the ground with layers that are important to the overall flavour of the road. When you add an extra ingredient – like water – your sandwich can become a mess.

The base of the road begins at its deepest point with the sub-grade material, which is typically native material or imported fill. On top of this layer is aggregate material of varying sizes of crushed stone and other granulars that are packed into place. Finally the whole thing is topped with asphalt.

The problem comes in the late winter and early spring when the heat of the sun can warm the asphalt base to several degrees above freezing, while the ambient air temperature can often be well below zero. As snow and ice melts, it can permeate the asphalt in areas. When that water refreezes, say after sunset or doing an especially cold day, the ice and trapped water will weaken the strength of the road.

By restricting the amount of weight a vehicle carries, the damage to weakened roads can be mitigated.

“Half-load season is an effective means to protect our roads,” said de-Haan. “It won’t be long before the weather warms even more, and we will remove the restrictions.”

84,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-way-back-more-than-a-sports-movie,"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Way Back’: More Than a Sports Movie,"The convergence of high-school basketball and alcoholism inevitably invokes Hoosiers, one of the greatest sports movies ever made. As if leaning into the comparison, The Way Back even gives one coach a heart attack and has the coach protagonist ejected from a game for raging at a referee.

But screenwriter Brad Ingelsby and director Gavin O’Connor (Miracle, Warrior) have other ideas. The Way Back blends the beats of two familiar genres, the underdog sports movie and the addiction and recovery movie, in the process finding a rhythm that feels at once familiar and not quite like anything I’ve seen before.

The two story elements overlap at Bishop Hayes High School in Los Angeles’ working-class San Pedro neighborhood, where Ben Affleck’s Jack Cunningham, a bearded, heavyset construction worker and hard-drinking but mostly functional alcoholic, was once a high-school basketball star with a seemingly bright future.

Jack isn’t looking to take on something new when he gets a call from his alma mater. The school’s longtime head, Father Devine (John Aylward), explains that their head coach suffered a heart attack and that their struggling team, the Tigers, could use an infusion of the vitality Jack brought to their game.

Jack, who has never coached and hasn’t touched a basketball in decades, tries to decline, but Father Devine insists that he sleep on it. In the harrowing evening binge that follows, Jack rehearses a series of increasingly ill-formed refusals.

What ultimately moves him to accept? The film shrewdly skips to Jack showing up at the next day’s practice. I like to think that in the end he just can’t say no to this priest from his youth.

The screenwriter’s brother, Martin Ingelsby, is head coach at the University of Delaware and played at Archbishop Carroll High School in Philadelphia and at Notre Dame. Their father, Tom, was a star player at Cardinal O’Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania, and at Villanova before going on to play for the NBA and ABA.

Clearly Ingelsby knows about two things: basketball and Catholic education. That life experience is reflected in the film’s authenticity in various respects, from the strategies Jack employs on the court for coaching a dark-horse team playing better opponents to the school culture at Bishop Hayes.

It’s likewise impossible to separate the persuasive messiness of Affleck’s performance and of Jack’s troubled relationship with alcohol with the actor’s well-documented, longtime struggles in this area and his repeated stints in rehab. (The film leans into this, too, with early shots almost overtly echoing the “Sad Affleck” memes of a few years ago, accompanied by somber, muted scoring.)

Perhaps Ingelsby knows something about alcoholism, too, since the screenplay is sharp with insight here. An early conversation at a Thanksgiving family reunion between Jack and his sister, Beth (Michaela Watkins), is a deft portrayal of the kind of awkward, circling exchange that occurs between a caring family member attempting a ginger intervention in the life of a loved one she doesn’t see often and the defensively indignant addict in denial.

What makes Jack’s denial harder to overcome is that he gets up every morning, drives himself to work, and puts in a full day at the construction site. He’s drinking all the time — the shower-head caddy basket that holds his beer each morning where he can reach for it along with his shampoo is among the most telling touches — and some nights he needs a ride home from the bar, if not a hand getting up the steps to his apartment door, but he gets through the day.

Now that Jack and his wife, Angela (Janina Gavankar, The Morning Show), are separated, no one is close enough to Jack for his drinking to cause friction as long as he doesn’t want to confront it.

That changes, of course, once he begins coaching at Bishop Hayes.

The team has a long tradition of failure, and Jack’s lack of coaching experience and undisciplined personality make for a rough start. But Jack knows basketball, and the gradual reawakening of that part of himself is moving to watch.

Among many small, thoughtful touches, Jack asks his assistant coach, an algebra teacher named Dan (comedian Al Madrigal) who was a benchwarmer in Jack’s glory days, what the dress code is for games. For head coach, Dan answers, coat and tie. (Jack technically fulfills this requirement at every game while still looking like a slob with his shirt untucked.)

As he did in Miracle, the veteran sports director carefully builds up the team’s game from their indifferent early play to their aggressive competitive style, at the same time ramping up the tempo and drama of the camerawork and editing.

If Miracle left most of its players undifferentiated, The Way Back efficiently develops a more vivid cast of characters, with the most attention given to a quiet player named Brandon (Brandon Wilson) whom Jack singles out not only for his superior skills but also for his deeper understanding of the game.

Unsurprisingly, with Jack’s short temper and foul mouth, the school’s code of conduct is a recurring challenge, and more than once the team’s chaplain, Father Mark (Mark Whelan), has to push back on him, most notably after an egregious display of poor sportsmanship in coaching at a demoralizing defeat.

When Father Mark gently brings up the topic of Jack’s R-rated language, Jack tries a theological dodge: With all the bad stuff going on in the world, does the priest really think God gives a fig, or something, about his language?

But the chaplain is unfazed: At Bishop Hayes, he says, the mission is to “integrate our faith into our lives” — and so, yes, Father Mark thinks God gives a fig about Jack’s language. (This is not one of those cases where Jack reaches for one of the harsher words he could have used, which is fortunate since the priest repeats the word back to him.)

Later there’s a more drastic confrontation with the other priest, Father Devine. As much as we empathize with Jack in this difficult scene, Father Devine is not only in the right, but clearly finds the moment as painful as Jack does.

A wholly positive Catholic priest, let alone two, in a mainstream Hollywood non-horror film is essentially unheard of today. The Way Back not only makes Father Devine and Father Mark moral authorities, it also makes them individuals. (Another small but notable touch: Head priest Father Devine wears clerical blacks while Father Mark wears street clothes.)

The religious element is low-key, as it was in Warrior, but it’s better integrated into the story here.

Many sports movies have issues larger than sports on their minds. In The Way Back the larger issues of Jack’s personal life subvert genre expectations with a third-act crisis in which Jack’s life becomes both more complicated and simpler.

Jack’s line about God caring about language isn’t his most theologically fraught; it’s clear that the anger he lives with is directed at God, and he has a despairing line about life after death that is not rebutted by a priest or anyone else. On the other hand, a priest-led prayer before the final game stands in significant contrast to the limitations that Jack, even at his best, brought to his coaching style and attitude.

More important, ultimately, than the interweaving of the two storylines is the balance they provide each other.

The young Bishop Hayes Tigers players stand in some ways where Jack stood decades earlier, the present bright, the future uncertain. Jack stands at a crossroads of his own, his past a long pileup of bad choices, consequences and heartache earned and unearned.

The Way Back finds a satisfying note to end on, but what matters most as the credits roll is the way forward.

Deacon Steven D. Greydanus is the Register’s film critic and creator of Decent Films

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

Caveat Spectator: Much heavy drinking and drunkenness; limited profanity, a few crude sexual remarks/jokes, and frequent harsh and crude language. Mature viewing.","Later there’s a more drastic confrontation with the other priest, Father Devine.

Article content Whelan last year was just in Grade 9 when the Panthers won the SDG crown for the second straight time. That led to another appearance at the Eastern Ontario (EOSSAA) championships, the Panthers coming oh-so-close to qualifying for the provincials but falling in a tight final against Bishop Smith from Pembroke. This time, the Panthers will head to EOSSAA next Tuesday (March 10) in Napanee. “I’m really looking forward to it,” said Whelan, who plays minor hockey at the midget AA level with the Lady Grads in Gloucester. “Hopefully we’ll have another good tournament.” Panthers coaches and administrators will have to do a little bit of stickhandling themselves that day, as the boys’ team also will travel to its EOSSAA event, being held in Renfrew. In the game against Tagwi, the Warriors kept things close early on, trailing just 2-1 late in the opening period. But, there was a disputed goal toward the end of the session, the Warriors making a pretty good case that the puck never crossed the line into the net, but it counted and the deficit became 3-1. Tagwi enjoyed some offensive pressure on a power play opportunity early in the middle session, but it would be the Panthers who scored, Kate Villeneuve with a shorthanded marker that made it 4-1. Villeneuve scored her second goal just over three minutes later, and she had two assists in the contest for a four-point effort. Olivia Mudde also scored for St. Joseph’s, and Macey Dionne had a pair of assists.

Experts say young-adults from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh

Addressing the obstacles faced by the younger generation in Bangladesh, especially from marginalized and indigenous parts of the society, will be a key to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), said experts and activists.

Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of the US-based charity The Hunger Project Bangladesh, said youths from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh. “They are deprived largely in social, academic, employment and even cultural affairs.”

“In order to reflect and materialize the SDG focus of leaving no one behind, we must focus on diversity, tolerance, pluralism and the atmosphere of acceptance among some major measures, or else, they will not only get derailed but also get involved in extremism in numbers,” he warned.

The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Chairman Rehman Sobhan said the work being done by the government and non-government organizations (NGOs) for the SDG implementation implies how serious they are.

Through engaging in the process, the government attest to its obstacles and reliance on the NGOs, he said, adding: “But did it formally recognize the role the NGOs are putting in?”

Rehman insisted on much more coordination among the government and non-state actors in attaining the SDG, for which he termed the next five years as highly crucial.

The noted economist suggested the civil society to recognize its role in the process and act as a pressure group, especially on behalf of the marginalized people.

“By assembling data, it can evaluate what has been and needs to be done alongside holding the government accountable for the development activities for the SDG implementation,” he further said.

Shaheen Anam of the citizen’s platform said achieving the SDGs by 2030 does not solely depend on the government’s efforts; rather it is a process that involves all citizens of the country.

“And in doing so, we have to focus more on the theme of the SDGs and the 16th goal, engaging more and more youths in the process,” she opined.

“In the past, we massively neglected the young population despite the latter being our future. We hardly thought of resolving the challenges they face,” Shaheen said.

The young must get assistance and guidance from all since their activities will decide where the country will be heading towards in the future, she said.

Transparency International Bangladesh’s (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said the 16th goal of the SDGs may be hampered by politicization within the administration, the judiciary and authorities concerned.

He alleged that the space of civil society in the development process is being gradually shrunk since it is failing to raise its voice and criticize any irregularities in development projects.

“Even the young, in many cases, feel threatened only for dissenting on any graft in the development process, thus, refraining from participating in the dialoge for accountablity,” he said.

KM Abdus Salam, director-general of NGO Affairs Bureau, said the young have nothing to worry about in inclusive growth as the government believes in ensuring development for all.

The event was addressed, among others, by the citizen’s platform Coordinator Anisatul Fatema Yousuf, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman, and ActionAid Bangladesh Country Director Farah Kabir.","The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

LONG SAULT — It was expected to be a thriller, and the championship game delivered.

The St. Joseph’s Panthers won the SDG boys’ high school hockey championship 3-1 over Char-Lan Tuesday in Long Sault, denying the Crusaders from Williamstown in their bid for a three-peat.

And it would be a house league player from South Stormont, Adam Winter, who was the Panthers’ hero in a wild third period, breaking a 1-1 tie with 1:51 to go in regulation time when at close range he took a pass from behind the net from captain Nolan Shane and calmly but quickly fired the puck into the open side.

“I shot along the ice – kept it simple,” said Winter, a Grade 12 student in his second year on the Panthers squad that has several AAA-calibre players and quite a few AA-level skaters.

Winter connected just after a St. Joseph’s power play ended, and just after the Crusaders almost went ahead when presented with a shorthanded breakaway chance. He tied up his opponent behind the goal and fell to the ice. Shane swooped in to get the puck, and by the time it was put out in front, Winter was back on his feet and off to the side of the goal.

“Nolan came back to the bench (afterwards) and said ‘I knew you would be there,'” Winter recounted.","Article contentLONG SAULT — It was expected to be a thriller, and the championship game delivered.

In 2016, Nigeria adopted GeneXpert as the first diagnostic tool for the disease. It currently has 399 installed throughout the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory.

Speaking at a press conference to mark the World Tuberculosis Day, in Abuja on Tuesday, the National Coordinator, National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program, Adebola Lawanson, said the move is to comprehensively strengthen the detection and ensure TB is completely eradicated in the country.

Every March 24, the World Tuberculosis Day is celebrated to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of TB, and to step up efforts to end the global TB epidemic.

The theme this year is “It is time”. The theme is a call for accelerated action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets to end TB epidemics by 2030.

Tuberculosis is an age-long infectious disease that affects the lungs, and one of the world’s top infectious killers, killing over 1.5 million people yearly.

Eradicating TB

Ms Lawanson said there is need to scale up the level of TB awareness among Nigerians.

“There is, therefore, the need to scale up the level of awareness of TB among Nigerians, as only about 30 per cent of Nigerians are aware of TB control and preventive methods.

WHO, in line with the SDGs, set a target of 2030, “to end the TB epidemic. In order to accelerate towards this goal, there have been a lot of controlled efforts that have been put in place.

“We have just 10 years towards the end of 2030, so a lot still needs to be done. And the slogan for this year is ‘check that cough, time no dey,” she said.

Efforts made so far

In his remarks, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said the automation of the GeneXpert machine was part of government’s effort to ensure universal health coverage.

He also said Nigeria is among the few countries to commence the use of child-friendly medicines for drug-resistant DR-TB after development.

Represented by the Director, Public Health, Eno Obong, he said, “In line with the END TB strategy, the Ministry of Health with the support of partners has made some strides in the fight against TB in Nigeria.

“We have adopted new rapid diagnostic tools as well as child-friendly medicines for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).

“It is noteworthy that Nigeria is among the few countries in the world that immediately commenced use of child-friendly medicines for DR-TB after development,” he said.

He also said engagements with the private sector in the provision of GeneXpert and other TB services has yielded positive results, with the private sector having one of the best diagnostic centres in the country.

“The private sector is also contributing about 13 per cent of the TB cases notified in the country. We are also scaling up expansion of TB services in private facilities in oil 36 states and the FCT in line with our robust public-private mix DOTS (PPM-DOTS) plan,” he said.

The country representative of KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, Bertrand Odume, urged all stakeholders to continue with the campaign of ending tuberculosis beyond the world tuberculosis day.

“We stand here to identify with national programme for tuberculosis and to reiterate our commitment not to relent in the fight against the disease.

“We hope that with collaborative efforts of the federal ministry of health departments, partners, those that are affected, and civil society organizations, we will be able to join countries like India and Indonesia in closing the enormous gap in TB burden in Nigeria,” he said.","As efforts are intensified to ensure that Nigeria becomes Tuberculosis (TB) free by 2030, the Federal Government has revealed plans to scale-up the number of GeneXpert machines in the country.

93,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ffd-forum-highlights-calls-for-debt-standstill/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,FfD Forum Highlights Calls for Debt Standstill,"The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) held its annual Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum) to hear remarks from officials on financing sustainable development in the context of COVID-19. The outcome document of the 2020 Forum was negotiated among Member States through virtual means, and placed under consideration via silence procedure.

Opening the virtual FFD Forum on 23 April 2020, ECOSOC President Mona Juul drew immediate attention to the importance of debt relief. She welcomed:

the Group of 20 (G20) Finance Ministers’ Action Plan calling to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries,

a call by the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,

actions by the Paris Club; and

the call by Pakistan’s Prime Minister for a Global Initiative for Debt Relief, proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt issue and financing for sustainable development.

Also on debt, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 are amplifying existing debt risks. He called for extending the G20’s proposed debt moratorium to all countries that request forbearance, including middle-income countries (MICs) that lose access to financial markets. He said more targeted debt relief also will be needed, and to address sovereign debt restructuring in a way that supports countries in achieving the SDGs.

UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also echoed the importance of debt relief, welcoming the initiatives from the G20, IMF, World Bank, and the Global Initiative for Debt Relief called for by Pakistan.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Board Chair for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization – GAVI, explained that for many vulnerable countries, COVID-19 began as an economic crisis as global demand fell for their export products, including oil and industrial metal. Income from tourism and remittances also fell. “Then the pandemic arrived and the health crisis set in,” she said, and the necessary measures to save lives compounded the economic crisis. She said that in developing countries, 70% of workers are in the informal sector, and for them, lockdowns mean no work, no money, and no food for their families. This “perfect storm” can amount to a food crisis and lead to unrest. She highlighted the proposal for a two-year “debt standstill” as a short-term response, followed by efforts to revamp health systems and make them more resilient.

Another theme of the officials’ remarks was illicit financial flows (IFFs). Juul stressed the need to combat and prevent IFFs, as all sources of finance must be mobilized to address the virus and its social and economic consequences. Muhammad-Bande added that IFFs must be fought so countries can prevent inequalities from deepening.

Speakers also highlighted gender-related impacts of the pandemic crisis. Juul said women both carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, and are overrepresented among frontline health workers. Guterres said the pandemic has shown how economies are sustained by the invisible, unpaid labor of women, and “returning to our previous path is simply not an option.” He said women’s leadership is needed to help avoid catastrophic consequences of economic instability on women and girls.

In a keynote address, Narbada Gumbonzvanda, Board Chair, Action Aid International, outlined Action Aid’s call for a global people’s bailout of at least US$4.6 trillion. Pointing to inequality as “the mother of all pre-existing conditions,” she said we are on the brink of catastrophe because of “the yawning gaps we have tolerated in social and economic rights such as access to healthcare, clean water and rights to decent work.”

Gumbonzvanda reported that two thirds of low-income countries are spending more on debt service payments than on public health care. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only one in five people is covered by any kind of pension, social protection or safety net.

Jay Collins, Citigroup Vice Chairman for Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory, suggested using the COVID-19 crisis to strengthen resolve against climate change, and learn how to manage setbacks. He said the mobilization of trillions of US dollars in capital demonstrates that the world is capable of radical responses in the developed world, but in the developing world, the fight has just begun.

Collins acknowledged that COVID-19 has moved the SDG targets further from reach and made them even more ambitious. However, he identified “silver linings” in investors’ interest in social factors, reporting that: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds are outperforming non-ESG benchmarks; risk models for investment are being reconsidered, giving additional weight to climate value-at-risk and other concepts; and ESG scores for companies are already falling for poor COVID-response behavior.

In a statement on the occasion of the Forum, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said the impacts of the pandemic will be felt across all SDGs and the seven action areas of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD. He said recovery actions must be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and AAAA to ensure that we recover in a more sustainable and resilient way, and the AAAA in particular can act as a roadmap to a more resilient economy in the post-COVID world.

The virtual informal meeting of the Forum served as its fifth annual session, since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD in 2015. The outcome document was negotiated among Member States through virtual means in a process led by the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Latvia, and was placed under silence procedure until 27 April 2020.

Juul said the text, once adopted, will represent the first universal agreement on UN policies to finance immediate response to COVID-19 and longer-term recovery.

94,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/japan-and-singapore-submit-2020-ndcs/,"Thu, 02 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Japan and Singapore Submit 2020 NDCs,"Japan and Singapore have submitted their 2020 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The 2015 Paris Agreement decision requested parties to communicate every five-years either a new NDC, or an update on their existing one, depending on the respective NDC timeframe. Parties decided that their NDCs would reflect each country’s highest possible ambition, and new NDCs would have to represent a progression from the previous ones.

Since both Japan’s and Singapore’s NDCs have a ten-year timeframe with 2030 as target year, in March 2020 they submitted an update on their first NDCs. Their communication on actions and achievements to date reveal both their approaches and ongoing activities, as well as how they consider their NDCs ambitious and fair in light of their respective national circumstances.

Singapore’s 2020 NDC submission emphasizes that its “updated NDC” reflects the following enhancements:

An expansion of greenhouse gas (GHG) coverage to include nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), a chemical with a high global warming potential that is released in some high-tech industries, such as electronics manufacturing; and

An economy-wide absolute GHG emissions limitation target, in place of the previous intensity target, with a clear peak emission level at 65 MtCO2e around 2030 to achieve a 36% reduction in Emissions Intensity from 2005 levels by 2030.

Reviewing its achievements so far, Singapore highlights that in 2019 it introduced an economy-wide carbon tax, which applies to direct emissions from facilities producing 25 ktCO2e or more GHG emissions in a year, without exemption. This covers 80% of Singapore’s carbon emissions and provides an economy-wide price signal to incentivize and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Singapore’s high population density mean that the risks of nuclear energy outweigh the potential benefits. The NDC describes the country as “alternative energy disadvantaged,” noting that limited land area, relatively flat land, low wind speeds, and lack of geothermal resources present challenges for deploying solar power on a large scale. Still, Singapore is moving ahead to spur the deployment of solar PV through continued investment in “research development and demonstration” in order to reduce cost, improve efficiency, and enable innovative modes of deployment. Singapore reports that it is on track to achieve 350 megawatt-peak in 2020, and aims to achieve at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. This would meet about 4% of Singapore’s current annual electricity needs, and 10% of daily peak electricity demand today.

Singapore notes that took early and ambitious policy measures to reduce GHG emissions, and these account for many of the gains to date:

Singapore switched from fuel oil to natural gas, so that in 2019 about 95% of its electricity was generated from natural gas, compared to 18% in 2000;

Energy is already priced at market cost without any subsidy to incentivize households and businesses to use energy prudently; and

Singapore was among the first to impose a vehicle quota system to cap vehicle growth, and the only country to set a zero-growth rate for cars and motorcycles.

Singapore is also implementing concrete measures that focus on:

For the transport sector: phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles and promoting the adoption of greener vehicles; making public and shared transport and active mobility the preferred mode of travel; and enhancing the environmental friendliness of its transport infrastructure;

For the buildings sector: mandating minimum energy performance standards; and supporting the research and adoption of cost-effective, energy-efficient, and renewable energy solutions; and

For industry: enhancing grant schemes to help companies improve their energy efficiency, and supporting the achievement of systems-level efficiency gains across the sector.

Singapore also provides information on adaptation efforts to address its vulnerabilities as a low-lying island state. These include: investing in research; protecting against sea-level rise; managing water and minimizing floods; keeping essential services running well and buildings and infrastructure safe; strengthening resilience in public health and protecting biodiversity; and ensuring a resilient food supply.

Japan’s 2020 NDC submission does not include an adaptation component, but rather focuses on the country’s mitigation efforts. The document emphasizes that Japan has reduced its GHG emissions by over 8% during fiscal years (FY) 2014 to 2017, while the preliminary figures for FY 2018 indicate approximately 12% cumulative reductions. Japan will continue to aim for a reduction of 26% by FY 2030 compared to FY 2013 (25.4% reduction compared to FY 2005), and pursue further efforts both in the medium-term and long-term to reduce GHG emissions beyond this level.

Japan’s NDC reflects the country’s emphasis on technological and energy efficiency improving measures in relevant production and consumption sectors. These include iron and steel, cement, pulp, and chemical industries as well as commercial, residential, and transport sectors. With regard to the “land use, land-use change, and forestry” sector (LULUCF), Japan promotes forestry industry measures, as well as forest and soil management to increase carbon stock.

Japan notes annual progress reviews of its Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, and states that the review of its reduction target will be carried out with a revision of the energy mix. With regards to energy conversion, Japan informs of: expanding renewable energy introduction; utilizing nuclear power generation whose safety is confirmed; and pursuing high efficiency in thermal power generation.

Having faced a drastic change in its energy circumstances due to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan decided on a new Strategic Energy Plan as a starting point for reviewing and rebuilding the country’s energy strategy from scratch. Japan’s Long-term Strategy under the Paris Agreement, which it submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2019, aims to accomplish a “decarbonized society” as early as possible and as close as possible to 2050. As explained in Japan’s 2020 NDC, the strategy foresees: “disruptive innovations,” such as artificial photosynthesis and other carbon capture, use and storage technologies; and the realization of a hydrogen society. The long-term strategy further informs of the following considerations:

The Japanese energy sector faces a lack of domestic fossil resources such as oil, natural gas, and coal, and is not equipped with international pipelines or interconnections;

There are concerns about Japan’s international competitiveness in terms of high energy costs resulting from increased fossil fuels procurement following the shutdown of domestic nuclear power plants;

Japan will engage with new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplying countries, noting growing LNG exports from the U.S. as well as Russia’s abundant resource potential in the Arctic Circle; and

Decarbonization of gas itself with moderate social costs will be sought using existing LNG / city gas infrastructure and consumer-side equipment.

The submissions from Japan and Singapore bring the total number of 2020 NDCs received to only six of 188 Paris Agreement parties (given the US notification to withdraw by 4 November 2020). Collectively the six countries represent only 2.8% of global emissions, based on data calculations by the World Resources Institute’s Climate Watch. Some insiders have expressed disappointment that most countries missed the informal NDC submission deadline in February 2020.

Based on the Paris Agreement, parties’ efforts are not only communicated in their NDCs but are also subject to various types of review, including: a review of implementation through the Agreement’s enhanced transparency framework; a review of compliance through an implementation and compliance mechanism; and a review of overall progress through a global stocktaking process every five years. It is through this iterative process of submitting and reviewing NDCs that parties to the Paris Agreement envisaged that international community will eventually achieve the Agreement’s long-term objectives.

The first global stocktake occurs in 2023. It is expected to address mitigation, adaptation, and finance.

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

96,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/a-bold-call-for-action-needed-on-measuring-sdg-indicators/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: A Bold Call for Action Needed on Measuring SDG Indicators,"The global SDG indicator framework, which is the foundation of the 2030 Agenda’s mutual accountability edifice, continues to have its value undermined by those who should champion it most. Consider blood donation campaigns. In most countries of the world, donating blood is voluntary. To raise donations, governments and health agencies traditionally appeal to social responsibility and a sense of civic solidarity, sometimes even providing incentives.

Imagine instead a scenario where the principal pitch-line of a donation campaign was that it remains a “voluntary” initiative, and citizens can always find “alternative” ways to express their civic responsibility. The likely result would be to discourage the noble action of blood donation.

This resembles the situation we are witnessing with the global SDG indicator framework. Following the most pessimistic declaration to date by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in September 2019, in which it noted with great alarm that the world is “off track” to meeting most of the SDGs, the response by the UN Statistical Commission at its latest session on 3-6 March 2020 was to tepidly “reiterate that the application of the global indicator framework is a voluntary and country-led process and that alternative or complementary indicators for national and subnational levels of monitoring will be developed at national level on the basis of national priorities, realities, capacities and circumstances.”

The SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, measured first and foremost by the global SDG indicators.

Why does the Commission take pains to repeat that the global indicator framework is a voluntary process, and why is it sanctioning the use of alternative indicators?

Importance of Monitoring the Global Indicators

The development and review of the global SDG indicator framework has been an arduous process that has lasted over five years and required the concerted effort of the entire international statistical community. The Commission’s seemingly paradoxical approach of downplaying its importance may be the result of objections from a small number of countries to certain SDG indicators or to their methodological specifications. Rather than tackle this handful of cases head-on, the Commission appears to have preferred portraying the entire SDG indicator framework as less binding, including allowing for “alternative” indicators and continuing to refer to it as “work in progress.”

Nobody is debating the fact the 2030 Agenda as a whole, and the SDG indicators in particular, are a voluntary commitment. But by constantly reiterating the voluntary nature of the global indicator framework, without advocating for its use for the purpose of global monitoring, the UN Statistical Commission – the highest intergovernmental decision-making body in statistics – sends an ambiguous message to countries that risks doing a disservice to the 2030 Agenda.

In our previous article published on this blog, we highlighted how poor SDG data are leading to poor implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s global commitments. In that article, we also suggested a number of pragmatic measures to tackle the huge data gaps, beginning with the need for the UN Statistical Commission to urge countries to monitor the global SDG indicator framework. Unfortunately, when the Commission met in March 2020 for its annual session, it missed this opportunity.

Alternative Indicators, Risky Substitutions

The Commission’s open invitation for countries to use “alternative” indicators may have serious consequences for global SDG reporting. To some readers, the terms alternative and complementary may at first glance appear almost equivalent. However, there is a profound difference between the two. To complement the global indicator framework with regional and/or national indicators means that countries should ostensibly report global indicators as the starting point, yet they are also free to deploy additional indicators for more specific purposes. By contrast, suggesting that “alternative” indicators can be developed effectively gives countries a blank cheque to substitute global indicators with different national indicators.

As we also noted in our previous article, alternative national indicators are invariably incomparable with global indicators, and this directly undermines the principle of mutual accountability on which the 2030 Agenda is built. There are no established criteria or procedures for determining when and how to substitute global indicators with national indicators, which leaves the door open to arbitrary choices. More importantly, when countries do not produce the official global indicators at national level, it becomes impossible to compile regional and global aggregates and thereby gain a sense of the world’s progress towards implementing the SDGs.

By allowing countries to develop “alternative” indicators, the UN Statistical Commission has overlooked associated risks, as well as the sage advice of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the Millennium Development Goal indicators (IAEG-MDG) – the predecessor mechanism to today’s IAEG-SDG. In its seminal report on Lessons Learned from MDG Monitoring from a Statistical Perspective, the IAEG-MDG noted one of the key weaknesses of the MDG monitoring framework was the fact that “discrepancies between national and international data, due to, among others, different methodologies, definitions, different choice of data sources, or time gap in release dates, created problems at the national level and tension in the international statistical community.”

The other challenge with using “alternative” instead of “complementary” indicators is that it may amount to a reinterpretation of UN Resolution 70/1 (by which the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Paragraph 75 states that: “global indicators…will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by Member States.”

The term “alternative” does not figure at all in the 2030 Agenda or its associated UNGA resolution. In introducing this term, with the real and not merely semantic implications explained above, the UN Statistical Commission has set a questionable precedent by blurring the boundaries between the roles of legislator and statistician.

Time is Running Out to Measure SDG Indicators

With a little over ten years left until the end of 2030, and an unenviable track record so far, half-hearted efforts and mixed messages will not get us to the finish line. A bold and unambiguous statement is needed to remind all actors that the SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, which are measured, first and foremost, by the global SDG indicators.

97,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-bodies-formalize-silence-procedure-for-decision-making-during-pandemic/,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Bodies Formalize Silence Procedure for Decision-making during Pandemic,"The UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council each have adopted a temporary methodology for decision-making while the COVID-19 pandemic prevents in-person meetings at UN Headquarters. The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

On 27 March 2020, the UNGA adopted decision 74/544, titled ‘Procedure for taking decisions of the General Assembly during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.’ The decision notes “the limitations recommended on meetings within the United Nations premises as precautionary measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.” Circulating the proposed decision for adoption, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said that from his consultations with the Assembly’s General Committee, “it is quite clear that we all agreed that, under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances, the General Assembly has to be able to take essential decisions related to the Organization.”

According to a step-by-step document on applying the silence procedure, the UNGA President will circulate a draft of a decision or resolution to all Member States, specifying the deadline for raising an objection and allowing at least 72 hours. At the same time, the draft is to be made available on the UN’s Official Document System in all official languages, except in extraordinary circumstances. Any information from the Secretariat on programme budgetary implications is to be circulated at the same time.

To make an objection, Member States can send a letter or Note Verbale via email to the UNGA President. The President will inform all Member States that the silence has been broken. The President then may choose to refer the draft decision/resolution and the objections to: the sponsors of the text; the co-facilitators of the UNGA-mandated processes for the 74th session; the Chair of the originating Committee; the Office of the UNGA President; or a facilitator designated by the President to lead further consultations. Any revised drafts would follow another round of the silence procedure.

If there are no objections within the specified time period, the UNGA President will circulate a letter confirming adoption. The step-by-step process also includes options for making an explanation of position. The document indicates that it is not technically possible to hold a vote under this temporary procedure.

All decisions and resolutions adopted via the silence procedure will be noted by the UNGA plenary at its first possible meeting in the General Assembly Hall.

For ECOSOC, on 1 April 2020, taking into account the UNGA’s agreement on the methodology, President Mona Juul circulated a proposal enabling the Council to adopt decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council adopted Decision 2020/205 on 3 April, and the procedure is in effect until the end of May 2020 unless extended through the same procedure.

According to the step-by-step guide, when the ECOSOC president intends to circulate a draft decision or resolution under the silence procedure, she will first consult the Bureau. Bureau members will then consult with the members of their respective regional group. The document notes that information about this consultation will be posted on ECOSOCPlace before a proposal is sent on silence procedure.

The draft is to be circulated to all Members of the Council with copy to all other Member States for their information, under a silence procedure of at least 72 hours. If the silence is not broken, the decision is considered adopted.

If objections are raised, the ECOSOC President may choose to refer the text and the objections to: the Vice-President responsible for coordinating matters under the item concerned; the sponsors; the co-facilitators of the ECOSOC processes for the current session; the Chair of the originating subsidiary body; or a facilitator to lead further consultations.

Other steps in the procedure are similar to those under the UNGA procedure, including the circulation of programme budgetary implications and the placing of the draft text into the UN’s document system in all official languages. Like in the UNGA, all decisions taken through the silence procedure will be noted at the first plenary meeting held “after the cessation of the precautionary measures as soon as the circumstances allow.” [UN News story on UNGA silence procedure] [All COVID-19 updates from ECOSOC President]","The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

The forward, by Henrik Hammargren, notes that defining “leadership” can be a difficult task, but identifies four characteristics: 1) that it can be both constructive and destructive and therefore must be scrutinized; 2) that it should not be condensed to a particular set of skills; 3) that it is often confused with—or reduced to—management capability; and 4) that the public discourse is too narrowly-focused on the individual, and should also recognize collective responsibility and action.

Making the case for the relevance of UN leadership in the current context, the report offers five precepts that provide a framing for 26 written contributions:

The responsibility of the UN and its mandate: leaders in the UN must act in the midst of—and in response to—endemic poverty, climate change, armed conflicts and human rights violations, and uphold the UN charter in the face of resistance The recognition that no one has a monopoly of knowledge over ‘leadership’: the voices and viewpoints expressed by the individual thoughtpieces differ, each offering their own perspective The relationship between leadership and management: noting the above caveat, leadership encompasses management, but the latter can be taught, learned or otherwise implemented, whereas leadership builds on a variety of other traits spanning ethics, integrity and courage Leadership is not just at the top: leadership is to be sought, enabled and nurtured at all levels of the organization, across a wide range of professional profiles Anchoring decisions in today’s realities: recognizing that past inspirations regularly surface, the report avoids a “golden age” or “what would Hammarskjöld have done” sentimentality, recalling his words that, “Your duty, your reward – your destiny – are here and now.”

The report organizes contributions beginning with a broad exploration of what principled leadership at the UN entails, and how leadership can build consensus to address global challenges and strengthen multilateralism. The second chapter describes lessons learned from, and attributes of, individual leaders, featuring inspirational stories and an exploration of the question, “who would you want to work for?” The report’s third chapter explores the institutional role of UN leadership in coalition-building, the relevance of feminist leadership to the UN, and the relationships between innovation and leadership. The final chapter takes stock of current leadership initiatives undertaken in the wake of the adoption of the UN System Leadership Framework, and utilizes data related to UN human resources functions to revisit past assumptions and review “unexamined symptoms of ailing leadership.”

Better leadership is essential not only for ensuring trust in the UN—and in multilateralism more broadly—but also for effectively responding to today’s global challenges, the report argues. It highlights a tension between realism and idealism, where leaders must uphold universal values and principles, but also must hold governments and people to account, which involves a unique set of risks and pressures. These pressures, the report recognizes, demand that a leader demonstrate grit and courage, but also humility, compassion and empathy.

The report concludes with three emergent learnings: for leadership to grow, failures must be recognized and discussed; further stock must be taken on the UN Leadership Framework’s implementation across a fragmented UN system; and if the UN is to be impactful beyond New York or Geneva, reflections on leadership must be shared beyond these spheres, going past inward-looking perspectives to include external experiences and stakeholders.

The publication’s focus on UN leadership derives from three factors: 1) the UN reform process, of which strengthening leadership features as a core pillar; 2) turbulence, where the UN is being questioned and having its contributions and budgets reduced; and 3) historical, as 2019 marked the “centennial anniversary of the international civil servant” and the founding of the League of nations. Additionally, this September will feature a celebration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, a key theme of which will be multilateralism.

Life is difficult right now – there’s no way to sugar coat it! We’re modifying our behaviours, adjusting our routines and giving up time with our loved ones. The pay off should be worth it, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard.

In difficult times, hearing heartwarming stories can provide us with an extra boost of positivity. Everyone is looking for ways to stay positive and to help make things just a little easier for their loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, etc. I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

There have been a lot of stories of individuals and organizations using their 3D printers to provide protective equipment to healthcare workers – within days of closing, Library staff were involved in testing these types of printing projects for Glengarry Memorial Hospital.

Since that first week, staff have been working to print face shields and most recently, mask straps. The face shields are still in progress, as the print jobs originally took nine hours and finding the clear plastic is difficult to source. The library has arranged to have their shields available to GMH staff as a back up should they run out of their supply of protective equipment. Thankfully, there has been no need for that yet.

The mask straps, designed to relieve the pressure on the ears from wearing a face mask for extended periods of time, were delivered to extremely grateful hospital staff last week.

We’re proud that we are able to use our equipment to provide support to our brave healthcare workers. Printing these items has been a real team effort, involving numerous staff to make it happen. Library staff continue to demonstrate that we are a resourceful bunch – and we’re ready to respond to any needs we can during this difficult time.","I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

Article content Hospitals in SDG and Prescott-Russell have about a week to a 10 days’ worth of personal protective equipment before they run out. Eastern Ontario Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis confirmed this Monday, saying unless the region received a massive supply of equipment within the next few days, local hospitals could be forced to decontaminate masks and reuse them. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG/Prescott-Russell to run out of PPE within 10 days: EOHU Back to video “We’re also being told that any day now we should be receiving a massive supply, so were crossing our fingers,” Roumeliotis said during Monday’s teleconference briefing. “At this point it’s either we decontaminate it and reuse it, or we get a big supply.” According to Roumeliotis, directives to decontaminate and reuse the equipment stemmed from both federal and provincial governments. “Medical-grade facemasks should be reserved only for healthcare providers,” he said. “Healthcare providers use those to protect themselves and to protect their patients.”

Roumeliotis still could not give an exact number when asked how many ventilators were in the Prescott-Russell and SDG area, citing that he did not have enough time to look it up. “I don’t have those numbers,” he said. “I’ve just had so many things to do.” Fifth centre opens

Five testing centres are now up and running in the EOHU area — Casselman, Hawkesbury, Winchester, Cornwall and Rockland, which opened its doors on Monday. Roumeliotis outlined there was the potential to open one in Alexandria, if needed. In total, the SDG and Prescott-Russell areas have 44 confirmed cases, with three of them currently in intensive care unit (ICU) and two in a non-ICU setting. Of the five hospitalized cases for the area, three are housed in the Cornwall Community Hospital — with two of them being in ICU. “They are all in stable condition,” answered Roumeliotis when asked about them. “There were rumours that there was a death due to the virus in the area. At this point, we haven’t had any reports of death related to COVID. So far, we haven’t had any deaths.” More On This Topic Eastern Ontario Health Unit now at 42 local cases of COVID-19 EOHU now at 34 cases, including first youth Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Data unveiled by the province on Monday outlined that of the 44 local cases, three have now been classified as resolved. Of those who tested positive, 22 are women and 24 are men. Only one case is reported as being under the age of 20. Three are in the 20s, eight in their 30s, four are in their 40s, 14 are in their 50s, 13 are in their 60s and two are in their 70s. One person’s age is labelled by the province as unknown.

Roumeliotis expressed once again that residents should not visit family members during the pandemic — especially during the upcoming Easter weekend. “Again, I urge everybody, please don’t get together with your families,” he said. “I know that for many it’s an important religious holiday, but it’s really important, particularly over the next week or two, that we stay at home, that we don’t gather and that we don’t go see grandma. “It’s well worth doing phone calls or getting together virtually to protect the most vulnerable in our community.” He also said the number of confirmed cases seems to have slowed down recently. “There’s a bit of a peak between March 14 and March 26,” said Roumeliotis. “We had about five to six new cases on a daily basis. Now it has sort of gone down. We’re looking at keeping that low and we’re going to be monitoring very closely.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine Resources: Ontario’s COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool

Article content Residents are urged only to call emergency medical services in case of a catastrophe, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services are preparing for an increase in call volume as the virus spreads. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Back to video “Efforts have been underway to ‘flatten the curve’, so that not everybody needs help at the same time,” said paramedic Chief Bill Lister. “We haven’t eliminated the curve, we’ve flatten it, but call volumes are anticipated to increase over the next few weeks and months. “As well as recognize that we’ll have an unusual call volume, and be patient as it may take us a little longer to get to the door steps than they’re traditionally used to.” They currently receive about 49 calls per day for cases around the region, but Lister expects that number to climb up to 60 once the pandemic reaches its peak. Lister insists people should only call 911 if they are experiencing a heart attack, stroke, become unconscious, or have severe, unexplained shortness of breath.

Article content “We’re looking for the calls that are unusual; if your shortness of breath feels like you’ve run a marathon, just getting off the couch,” said Lister. “Those are calls that should be called to 911. If you’re just unwell because of the flu, those are ones that you should probably stay at home; 80 per cent of the population will recover without the need for any kind of intervention.” He said people should contact the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, Telehealth and use self-assessment tools online to determine if they do indeed need emergency assistance, if they feel like they have COVID-19 symptoms. Those who need to go to the hospital, require a medical appointment or need to go to an assessment centre should call a friend, take a taxi or use public transit if they can get there without the need of an ambulance. This would relieve the need of tying up lines for those who actually need assistance. “We’re trying to save the resources for the sickest people and everybody who can participate in that would help us,” said Lister. “We’ve been anticipating this climb and the health units have been very proactive in advising of what the epidemiology of this would be.” The unit currently has 66 full-time and 54 part-time paramedics. They plan to hire 12 to 20 more employees due to the pandemic. More On This Topic Three City of Cornwall departments hit with provincial funding changes New safety features added to Cornwall-SDG ambulances “There’s been a bit of a problem with the colleges closed before paramedic students could graduate,” said Lister. “We’re working around that. It’s not much of an issue right, but the hiring process takes a couple of weeks and we’re hoping to have that up and running very shortly.”

Article content Paramedics follow a strict point of care risk assessment process to protect themselves of any exposure to the virus when treating a patient. “The first is a screening tool that the dispatcher system uses,” said Lister. “If they display or complain of any kind of flu like symptoms, the dispatchers will alert the medic that these people might have an infectious situation going on and they should take precautions.” Paramedics will conduct an assessment two metres away from the patient, because the belief is COVID is droplet-spread, which means it is spread through coughing or mucous-membrane contact. The paramedics do wear gloves and gowns. They’ll wear a face shield and goggles and a mask. The unit also has an infectious disease process to ensure equipment is clean and free of immunological conditions. “It’s in place all the time, not just in COVID,” said Lister. “It’s heightened now. We’re doing more environmental cleaning that carries on. Most of the equipment is disposable, where we throw it out after a one-time use. The equipment that isn’t, like the stretchers, we clean them between each patient contact. We have use a hydrogen peroxide base cleaner that’s been recommended for any type of virus or bacteria. “We’re quite comfortable and confident that once the cleaning process has been done, the place is safe for the next patient.” Elective surgeries such as routine mammograms have been cancelled to free up room space in anticipation of what’s to come. Lister said the growth rate is difficult to determine at this time. There are currently 14 ambulances in the fleet, with three as spares that are used for mechanical issues such as maintenance or repairs. The goal is to have 14 on the road during the peak height of the pandemic. If for any reason one of the Cornwall-SDG ambulances wasn’t available, provincial dispatch protocols would send the next-closest available ambulance, even if it had to come from outside of SDG. jsantos@Postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

The simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Walking trails accessible over much of the Cornwall/SDG region Back to video

A lot of public spaces and walking trails are closed, but there are still opportunities in the region for people to get out and stretch their legs.

The Raisin Region Conservation Authority, as part of its response to COVID-19, closed the Gray’s Creek Marina, including access to docks and the boat launch until further notice, but the public can still enjoy its network of nature trails, at the conservation area and also at the Cooper Marsh Conservation Area and Charlottenburgh Park.

The RRCA is continuing to require visitors to practise physical distancing, avoid gathering in groups, and refrain from touching common surfaces.

A number of activities, of course, had to be cancelled, including the popular annual Raisin River Canoe Race the RRCA organizes.

But, some services have continued, including the spring seedling sale. The RRCA before Easter weekend noted there were still a limited number of white pine and white spruce seedlings available for order, and those who purchased tree seedlings will be contacted soon, with information on the pickup date, along with the precautionary measures in place to ensure staff and customer safety.","Walking trails accessible over much of the Cornwall/SDG regionArticle contentThe simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

Of 61 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, a multi-coloured map indicated 36 have been in Prescott-Russell, 15 in SDG and 10 in Cornwall, the numbers as of noon on Wednesday.

Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Back to video That Prescott-Russell has the highest number does not come as a surprise to Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, the medical officer of health who in his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon said that county has 92,000 residents – more than twice the population of Cornwall, and about 28,000 more than in SDG – many living in close proximity to Ottawa, where COVID-19 has been very prevalent. “Many people who live in Prescott-Russell work in Ottawa,” the doctor said. The website presentation has several graphs and statistics, the EOHU saying it’s the most accurate information available from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS).

Article content Of the 61 cases, five people currently are hospitalized, with three in ICU. There’ve been 34 patients who’ve recovered. The latest release in the Ontario data indicated no increase in local positive cases between Monday and Tuesday, the number still at 61. Provincial data indicates three more cases are considered resolved, for a total of 45 in that category, although the total is different from the aforementioned EOHU data. Other information provided Wednesday by Roumeliotis included the two local cases involving health-care workers, who work in Ottawa. One was disclosed on March 22, a man in his 30s from Prescott-Russell who works at one of the campuses of the Ottawa Hospital. Nothing has been released about the other. Roumeliotis indicated there have not been any outbreaks at any long-term care facilities or retirement residences.

Article content Roumeliotis said he expects there’ll be eventually a gradual progression in the loosening of social measures, including larger crowd sizes, but that “I don’t believe we’ll be in a state of normalcy before the late fall, and maybe not until the early winter.” Asked if there could be an emergency curfew put in place, as is the case in Akwesasne, Roumeliotis said it’s a possibility, if physical distancing and other measures weren’t being followed, and the number of COVID-19 cases began rising to the point it overwhelmed hospitals. “(A curfew is) on the table, it’s something we’ve discussed as our next step (aimed at) curtailing gatherings,” he said. “If we feel that measures need to be taken, they’ll be taken.” Roumeliotis said the number of tests done at assessment centres in the region is at just about the 800 mark. The breakdown is as follows: Hawkesbury 292; Cornwall 198; Casselman 165; Rockland 90; Winchester 51. The doctor said about half of the tests have results that are known, and that those still pending should have results come in “in the next day or so.” One graph on the EOHU website for cumulative total confirmed cases in the region, after having an upward curve for most of mid-March into early April, has levelled off over the last handful of days. Responding to whether he expects another surge, Roumeliotis said “it’s hard to say, (but) I hope not. I think what we are trying to do now is level it off. . . we’re having the odd case here, a case there, but it’s a manageable number. Our hospitals are indeed still coping.”

North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban. . . we recognize that many (residents) are eager to resume burning for both agricultural and recreational purposes.”

Meanwhile, in South Stormont, Fire Chief Gilles Crepeau partially lifted the total burn ban for agriculturally-zoned properties only, effective 12 p.m. Friday, in an effort to allow farmers to prepare for the upcoming planting season.

Effective Thursday, the one in North Glengarry, which had been put in place April 3, was lifted.

Total burn bans, implemented to prevent unneeded firefighting calls in the age of COVID-19, are slowly starting to lift.

“We need your help to keep our community safe,” he said.

All open air burns must be monitored at all times, and burning noxious materials – including plastics, tires, garbage and construction materials – is not permitted.

In South Stormont, where there’s a partial lifting of the burn ban, all agriculturally-zoned permit holders must contact Crepeau at 613-534-8889 ext. 250, or at gilles@southstormont.ca, for authorization prior to any burns. Those planning agricultural burns that do not have a permit can download the application and drop the application off at the dropbox outside the main entrance of town hall in Long Sault, along with a cheque for the $10 permit fee.

Those applying for a new permit must also contact the chief for authorization to burn prior to any burning. Each property requires its own permit, and must follow the bylaw.

Crepeau said the township burn ban for recreational fires and open-air burning on properties not zoned agricultural remains in place and will be reviewed on a week-to-week basis. Should any restrictions be lifted or reduced, an announcement will be made.

“I want to do it in stages,” Crepeau told the Standard-Freeholder on Friday. “I know people are getting anxious. I respect that everyone the last six or seven weeks has accumulated (a lot of burn items), and people want to have something to do – they want to have a bonfire.

“I think any week now, we’ll (have a full) lift.”

But, the chief said, it’s been a dry season, and with a high risk of grassfires, at this time, this year, only a partial lift makes sense. A lot of the decision will be weather-based, he said, but in the meantime, prior to a full lift, and because offices and processing times are different, it’s a good idea to submit applications now, or soon, so that “when (the ban is) lifted you’ll already have your permit,” Crepeau suggested.

Outside of those two townships, it’s best to check with your local municipality on whether any outdoor burns are permitted— including the City of Cornwall, where there is no open-air burn bylaw in place, so provincial regulations apply.","North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban.
Total burn bans, implemented to prevent unneeded firefighting calls in the age of COVID-19, are slowly starting to lift.
In South Stormont, where there’s a partial lifting of the burn ban, all agriculturally-zoned permit holders must contact Crepeau at 613-534-8889 ext.
Those applying for a new permit must also contact the chief for authorization to burn prior to any burning.
Crepeau said the township burn ban for recreational fires and open-air burning on properties not zoned agricultural remains in place and will be reviewed on a week-to-week basis."

Funding will be parcelled out in increments and construction is expected to begin in 2021.

“What was proposed by the manor was that 25 per cent would be provided upon the commencement of construction, 50 per cent when building is (half) complete and the final 25 per cent when the building is 75 per cent complete,” said Simpson

Coun. Steven Byvelds said the manor would be a great addition the counties and that once the COVID-19 pandemic ends, more manors and long-term care facilities would need to be refurbished.","Article contentThis article has been edited to fix an incorrect reference in the lead paragraph.

Roumeliotis leads 2019 Sunshine List for Cornwall/SDG Back to video Leading the pack at the City of Cornwall level is chief administrative officer (CAO) Maureen Adams, who made $219,383 in 2019. That compared to a wage of $205,968 in 2018. Cornwall’s general manager of planning, development and recreation Mark Boileau, was the second-highest local municipal earner, making $164,424, as opposed to $161,582 he made in 2018.

Cornwall’s manager of employee relations Bruce Donig, earned $138,721 in 2019, whereas he earned $134,156 in 2018.

Article content The 2019 list revealed some of Cornwall’s top earners, such as Adams, Clarke and Bailey, received an increase to their salaries that was higher than the 1.9 per cent provided to the employees represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees in 2019. Management wage increases are often tied to what the city’s unionized workers receive. According to Clarke, the management salary grid also echoes the one in union agreements. Which means, not just the annual cost-of-living bump, but also additional pay after a certain amount of time on the job. “We give everybody the same increase as the union had,” he told the Standard-Freeholder. “The increases you see are promotional grid steps. If I make $20 this year and my next step is $22, but it’s a 1.9 per cent increase, it’s $22 plus the 1.9 per cent increase. “What you see is somebody progressing through their pay band.” More On This Topic Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Cornwall/SDG 2018 Sunshine list The 2019 sunshine list also featured several members of the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the Cornwall Fire Services. Cornwall Police Chief Danny Aikman topped the list for first responders, earning $206,095 last year, as opposed to $183,346 in 2018. The 2019 year was his first full year as chief of police, the difference in earning reflecting his promotion. Another promoted officer, Deputy Chief Shawna Spowart, earned $173,226 in 2019, whereas she had made $151,872 in 2018.

For the pilot accelerator, it has selected 11 startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

The program, which has been moved online for the time due to the pandemic, which run for 5 months, beginning from April 21.

Due to the current corona crisis all physical elements (e.g. workshops, events) of the program have been transformed into a virtual version in order to support both the startups and the people behind them. All 11 finalists will now have access to a five-months accelerator program provided by Google for Startups. Google

Out of the 11 startups selected, mDoc, a Nigerian healthcare startup that uses technology to make health services more accessible to people is one.

Here is what mDoc does

mDoc provides 24 hours support to people in sub-Saharan Africa with chronic diseases. It does this by connecting people through a virtual network to healthcare service providers using its app.

Through its tech platform, mDoc has a secured centralized repository of users’ healthcare information and uses it to connect them to various practitioners such as nutritionists and coaches.

The experts, in turn, help users with their health goals. They also help people find quality in-person healthcare when needed.

mDoc’s geo-coded database of healthcare providers makes it easy for users to access quality health care from different parts of Africa using their health information which can be updated and monitored on mDoc’s app.

Why was mDoc selected?

Besides its laudable operations and using tech to deliver quality services, the health startup was selected because its services align with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined by the United Nations.

By tackling the problem of access to quality healthcare and support for people with chronic disease, mDoc is working to realize SDG number 3 in Africa.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3

We’re modifying our behaviours, adjusting our routines and giving up time with our loved ones. The pay off should be worth it, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard.

In difficult times, hearing heartwarming stories can provide us with an extra boost of positivity. Everyone is looking for ways to stay positive and to help make things just a little easier for their loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, etc. I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

There have been a lot of stories of individuals and organizations using their 3D printers to provide protective equipment to healthcare workers – within days of closing, Library staff were involved in testing these types of printing projects for Glengarry Memorial Hospital.

Since that first week, staff have been working to print face shields and most recently, mask straps. The face shields are still in progress, as the print jobs originally took nine hours and finding the clear plastic is difficult to source. We have arranged to have our shields available to GMH staff as a back up should they run out of their supply of protective equipment. Thankfully, there has been no need for ours yet.

The mask straps, designed to relieve the pressure on the ears from wearing a face mask for extended periods of time, were delivered to extremely grateful hospital staff last week.

We’re proud that we are able to use our equipment to provide support to our brave healthcare workers. Printing these items has been a real team effort, involving numerous staff to make it happen. Library staff continue to demonstrate that we are a resourceful bunch – and we’re ready to respond to any needs we can during this difficult time.

“Our first goal is to keep more ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve,” said Lister. “The loose prediction is that we will need seven new ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve.”

He explained that this would bring the total number of ambulances on the road in the region to 14, though he added he would be more comfortable with 17.

That being said, Lister also explained that overall, his service was seeing a lower call volume than is typical for this time of year. He said that for the past week, his service was receiving around 40 calls a day, and that normal levels were around 50.

Lister credited the cancellation of elective surgeries by hospitals, and the provincial and local orders to self-isolate, keeping people at home and out of danger.

On Friday, April 3, in a teleconference with local media, Chief Lister said that his service was expecting and preparing for a spike in call volumes related to COVID-19.

“We are expecting call volume to climb dramatically in the next few weeks and months,” said Lister. “We are preparing to meet that demand, but we need the support, understanding, and patience of residents.”

In addition to adding more ambulances to the road, Lister said that he also planned on hiring another 12 to 20 part-time paramedics to supplement the 66 full-time and 54 part-time paramedics already on staff.","CORNWALL, Ontario – Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services Chief Bill Lister told Cornwall City Council during a Special Meeting on Tuesday, April 7 that his goal was to get seven more ambulances on the road to deal with any future spike in COVID-19 cases in the region.

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

It argues that the “true test” of 2030 Agenda financing is not how much is invested in projects on one or more of the 169 SDG targets, but whether projects are designed to minimize the negative externalities and maximize the positive externalities across multiple Goals and targets.

Authors Maria Alejandra Riaño and Damien Barchiche explain that synergies among SDGs and their targets “do not occur automatically.” As shown by the ongoing pandemic, one missing element such as efficient governance, health system, energy provision, or management of natural resources—can have effects throughout the economy and society.

This is related to the growing risk of “SDG-washing,” the authors suggest. Understanding the actual impact of investment flows is particularly important during a crisis. They report that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on several initiatives to help map financing flows to the SDGs and assess remaining needs and gaps.

With regard to country-level financing, the brief recommends developing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, as agreed by UN Member States in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development. The Frameworks would spell out financing and implementation plans for the national sustainable development strategy, thus providing investors with clarity and predictability “across the three time horizons of relief, recovery and long-term structural transformation.”

The issue brief titled, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: prerequisites, and opportunities for the post-Covid-19 crisis,’ says effectively implementing and financing the 2030 Agenda requires “forceful” alliances and partnerships that are grounded in local and national needs and capabilities, invest heavily upfront, invest in innovation and use science-based solutions, and have the support and participation of government authorities.

An Assessment of VLRs to Date,"There are only ten years left to deliver the 2030 Agenda. However, as speakers and reports prepared for the 2019 SDGs Summit clearly demonstrated, we are not progressing fast enough. To increase momentum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres inaugurated the ‘Decade of Action’ in January 2020. The Decade is built on three levels of action—global action, local action, and people action—to accelerate progress on the SDGs.

Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) could be an important vehicle to accelerate ‘local action’. Four VLRs were launched during the July 2018 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – by Kitakyushu, Shimokawa, and Toyama in Japan, and New York City in the US. These VLRs have ignited enthusiasm among other cities.

Building on these efforts to localize the SDGs and to further our contribution to the “Decade of Action,” the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) has released two complementary publications to highlight and support the work of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) in implementing the 2030 Agenda:

The “State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs” is a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020.

“The Shimokawa Method for Voluntary Local Review: A Blueprint for Localising the SDGs” is a method on how to conduct a VLR based on Shimokawa’s experience.

We understand the VLR as a process in which LRGs voluntarily review and follow-up implementation of the SDGs. This process becomes a vehicle for sharing experiences, challenges and lessons learnt, as well as to open avenues for new partnerships to address any current shortcomings LRGs might confront. It can also enable LRGs to engage communities in the process, thereby strengthening the accountability and inclusiveness of their policymaking.

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report analyzes the 16 VLRs that had been identified as of February 2020. Of these “first generation” VLRs, four were launched in 2018, ten in 2019, and two in 2020 (all are available at the VLR Lab, here). After summarizing the main characteristics of the 16 VLRs, this report focuses on two crucial aspects of conducting a local review: the level to which the VLR process engages with stakeholders, and the alignment of the VLR with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process. The report reviews the impressive number of commitments and actions that are already underway at the local level, details which are often missing in VNRs.

The comparative analysis of VLRs revealed that conducting a VLR can unlock meaningful opportunities for cities and regions. In particular, a VLR: 1) allows the local government to listen to the needs of its people and reflect them into local policymaking; 2) invites self-reflection; 3) provides for a process that is data-driven and can be used to plan for action to achieve the future we want; and 4) gives a local take on the global conversation on sustainable development. Altogether, these opportunities can lead to transformation. The report also found that the majority of the first generation of VLRs have focused chiefly on aligning the SDGs with local policies, but have not explicitly included a stakeholder engagement process, with notable exceptions being Shimokawa, Manheim, and New Taipei.

In the conclusion of the report, we emphasized the need to envision the next generation of VLRs. The next generation should maximize the meaningful opportunities provided by the VLR process, as identified in the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report, to capture all its benefits. We suggest that these opportunities will only be fully crystalized once the current approach is changed.

A key recommendation for maximizing these benefits is to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the VLR process, and to enable this engagement to be thorough and self-organised. In the case of Shimokawa, a community-led platform with staff from all bureaus of the town hall developed the new 2030 vision, fully embracing the SDGs. This vision then guided Shimokawa’s comprehensive plan (the highest level of planning), and contributed to fostering ownership of the town vision and plan. In addition, Shimokawa specifically tried to engage communities during the action-plan setting phase and helped establish an implementation platform that could mobilize different stakeholders for different community-led initiatives.

This planning process was built on “backcasting,” an approach that identifies a desirable outcome and then walks backwards to find measures to reach the final destination. The case of Shimokawa demonstrates that this approach enables a more robust, transformative policy process than through the use of forecasting, while also allowing for continuously revisiting the vision initially set if the circumstances change.

The report on the Shimokawa Method for VLRs builds on the mechanism used in the Shimokawa case, translating it into ten practical and straightforward steps, This report also incorporates findings from the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report and contains a guide for “VLR format” to which cities can refer as they construct their own VLRs.

The Next Generation of VLRs

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report presents an assessment of the currently available VLRs, while the Shimokawa Method report provides a handbook for implementing VLRs. These two documents seek to pave the way for improving the VLR process. While many internal areas of improvements related to VLRs can be addressed by using the Shimokawa method, more must be done. In particular, when looking to increase the global and national impact of VLRs, cities must strive to integrate their VLRs with their national VNR processes, so that a country can address territorial challenges and scale up successful local solutions.

The principles that underlie the 2030 Agenda resonate strongly with the ongoing global crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic is reminding humanity that society as a whole is as vulnerable as its most vulnerable people. It also brings into sharp focus the ramifications of inequality at many levels. These challenges cannot be suddenly alleviated during the crisis. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.” Recovery must go beyond “returning” and aim to “Build Back Better”, anchored in leaving no one and no place behind. VLRs can be instrumental to this end, building resilience and transforming our cities.

Our world is packed with knowledge and we can achieve SDG6 goals if we remain engaged

The world is facing an unprecedented global threat due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its impact on sustainable development prospects are emerging as a matter of concern.

The pandemic has underlined the need for global action to address people’s basic requirements, save our planet and to build a fairer and resilient world. This is what the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the global blueprint to end poverty, protect our planet and ensure prosperity is about.

At the heart of the agenda, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most of which are interconnected.

Earlier this year, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs. However the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic has exposed fundamental weaknesses in our global systems and highlighted the need to respond with urgency and determination.

In view of the current pandemic, the fate of SDG 6, “Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All” becomes more critical.

The goal is divided into six targets:

SDG 6.1: Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. Washing hands is the first line of defense to prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to experts, washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, repeatedly throughout the day, is critical. However, in many developing countries, the message ignores an important question: What if you don’t have enough clean water to meet the needs?

It becomes imperative to understand the close nexus between the ongoing pandemic and water woes of many countries. Globally, three billion people do not have access to even basic hand-washing facilities at home. Nearly a billion people experience only partial access or regular shutoffs even when they do have piped water, making frequent hand-washing difficult or impossible.

Lack of access to clean water affects vulnerability to disease and ill health. Handwashing and good hygiene practices unlock the benefits of water and sanitation services.

Proportion of population using a hand-washing facility with soap and water (%). Data source: SDG indicator 6.2.1b.

For this purpose, the UN-Water members and partners are committing to the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, which will unify the international community and deliver rapid results in countries at an increased scale as part of the Decade of Action.

This has led governments and organisations worldwide to believe that strategic and pragmatic plans should be in place to ensure sustainable access to safe water and sanitation. Governments need to take measures not only to increase water access, but create more resilient communities by addressing the root problems of water scarcity.

The onus lies on governments to be the prime driver of strategic planning of water supply, to ensure that adequate water is available to all, including the vulnerable sections of the society.

There is a need for appropriate funding for water and sanitation that not only build more resilient and thriving communities, but also boost local economies. Proper allocation and management of available water supplies to flatten the water deficit curve is also needed.

In countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks basic drinking water service, the initial focus must remain on ensuring access to an improved drinking water source to all and reducing the time spent (primarily by women and girls) in fetching water.

The need of the hour is also to also establish a commonly agreed method for assessing affordability, as payment for services should not be a barrier to accessing services.

In countries where water resources are limited, the governments should work on the existing water paradigm.

Unfortunately, most water supply and sewage treatment projects are approved as infrastructure projects. In addition, a growing built-up area in the name of ‘urbanisation’ leads to increased water run-off and minimal recharge.

A shift from a disposal-based linear system to a recovery-based closed loop system and investment in local rainwater harvesting and wastewater reuse is needed. It is here where the approach of water sensitive urban design and planning (WSUDP) can be useful.

WSUDP, being the integrated design of the urban water cycle, combines water supply, wastewater, storm-water and groundwater management, urban design and environmental protection, contributing towards sustainability and livability, particularly when considered as part of an overall urban strategy.

SDG 6.2: Achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

It calls for countries to end open defecation, to ensure that everyone has access to a basic toilet and to put in place systems for safe management of excreta. Better sanitation is considered to be one of the key elements in management of COVID-19 spread.

It stresses on the need to ensure that human waste is collected, transported,treated and disposed of or handled safely in compliance with the WHO’s Guidelines on Sanitation and Health. This is an important precaution for preventing potential transmission of COVID-19.

However, the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from faeces of an infected person appears to be low. According to the latest guidelines by WHO, current evidence suggests that infectious COVID-19 virus may be excreted in faeces, regardless of diarrhoea or signs of intestinal infection.

However, to date, only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal-oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus.

More data and analysis are required to validate the findings. Keeping in view that 2.3 billion people still lack basic services, considerable investment will be needed, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, although solutions will vary depending on the relative importance of sewerage networks and on-site sanitation systems.

Some other measures under SDG 6.2 are as follows:

Excreta of a city/country can be analysed through an advocacy tool called Excreta Flow or Shit Flow Diagram. The tool helps to understand if the excreta flow through the sanitation value chain is safely / unsafely managed and also bridges the existing gap in availability of data for monitoring safely managed sanitation and for improved citywide sanitation planning and effective sanitation investments in urban areas.

Strengthening the capacity of local and national authorities to manage and regulate sanitation systems will be a high priority, including the development of information management systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Need to re-design demand by reducing water usage so that water wastage is reduced. Need to re-design sewage management systems so that we treat wastewater to return manure to the land and clean water to our rivers. A combination of centralised as well as decentralised solution is required to ensure that waste of the entire area / city is being treated.

SDG 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimising release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.

With the global lockdown, water bodies are receiving minimal industrial hazardous and solid waste. As a result of this, the quality of water in rivers and lakes has partly improved. However, this is a temporary solution and calls the decision makers to revisit our planning approach of cleaning water bodies.

There is a need to have a combination of approaches, sewage treatment plants (STPs), effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and decentralised wastewater / solidwaste treatment systems which will treat the domestic and industrial waste before entering the water body, thus enduring less pollution.

The process of decentralised wastewater management furnishes the recycle and reuse of wastewater — a process of treating wastewater as a resource rather than a liability. Moreover, increasing political will to tackle pollution at its source and to treat wastewater will protect public health and the environment, mitigate the costly impact of pollution and increase availability of water resources.

Other measures are:

Setting up of effective real time water quality monitoring stations for robust data and analysis

Adhering to discharge norms by STPs and ETPs

Maintain­­­­ the flow of water bodies by keeping a tab on over-extraction and over exploitation of water bodies

SDG 6.4: Substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.

COVID-19 has brought to the limelight the need to be water prudent and water wise to tackle water scarcity. Awareness and mindset changes are required to use water efficiently.

SDG 6.5: Implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.

Adequate integrated water resource management is one of the most powerful tools to ensure supply of drinking water and wastewater treatment.

Role of integrated urban water management (IUWM), integrating water supply and demand, wastewater management, storm water, etc., has been suggested as a way out to sustainable water management by several researchers.

IUWM is a comprehensive approach to urban water services, viewing water supply, drainage, and sanitation as components of an integrated physical system, and recognises that physical system sits within an organisational framework and a broader natural landscape.

SDG 6.6: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.

This looks far to be achieved this year. The effect of climate change on the ecosystem cannot be ignored, instances of frequent floods and droughts is the new normal and to top it all, recent forest fires in USA and Australia are witness to the effects of climate change.

The linkage between ecosystem and climate change has to been deeply analysed and outcome-based solutions are required.

On March 31, 2020, the UN Secretary-General announced the establishment of a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. This multi-donor trust fund aims to raise $1 billion this year and one of the aims is to safeguard the SDG programmes from COVID-19-induced setbacks.

It has also called for a $2.5 trillion coronavirus crisis package for developing countries. This is a good start, but there is a lot more to be done to enable the developing countries to achieve their SDGs, particularly in the areas of water and sanitation for all.

According to UN Secretary-General António Guterres:

A recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must not take us back to where we before the pandemic. It is an opportunity to build more sustainable and inclusive societies — a more resilient and prosperous world.

The main challenge to achieve SDG 6, is that the water sector is struggling to improve water resources management and to increase the coverage and quality of water and sanitation services. As the world responds to this pandemic, there is a need to focus on addressing underlying factors through the SDGs especially for developing countries:

Need more financial and technical support and increased knowledge to fulfil their SDGs on water and sanitation for all.

Enhanced policymaking to take account of social cost-benefit approach when pricing water, strengthening environmental laws and creating ecosystem-centric regimes, and making technology sustainable

Every citizen needs to be careful in the use of water, as a society we need to be water wise, every drop of water counts. The current conditions provide an opportunity to promote the idea of maintaining hygiene as it is imperative now and should be encouraged in the future too.

At this point of time what is desperately needed is political will and commitment. Our world is packed with knowledge, innovation and capacity, and if we remain engaged, influential, productive we will be able to achieve the SDG 6 goal.","In view of the current pandemic, the fate of SDG 6, “Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All” becomes more critical.

They also agreed on UNEA’s input to the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and considered the way forward on the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, in 2022.

At the 150th meeting of the CPR on 30 April 2020, the UNEP Secretariat updated the CPR on preparations for UNEA-5. The session will have the theme, ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ It is expected to convene in Nairobi, Kenya, from 22-26 February 2021.

The Secretariat described the session’s expected strategic and thematic elements, which include:

Agreement by the multilateral community on four areas for transformative action for nature to achieve the SDGs: Action area 1: Nature for Jobs and Economic Prosperity Action area 2: Nature for Health Action area 3: Nature for Climate Action area 4: Nature for Sustainable Food Systems

The importance of communication to citizens, and plans for the ‘Actions #ForNature’ campaign that blends the World Environment Day ‘Time #ForNature’ campaign with the UNEA theme; and

The relevance of the UNEA-5 theme in the era of COVID-19, in light of the need for urgent, transformative, and sustained actions to “deliberately reshape humanity’s interaction with nature,” including by re-building economies in ways that address systemic threats to nature (e.g. unsustainable consumption and production, rapid urbanization, weaknesses in governance and accountability).

Committee members pointed to UNEA-5 as an opportunity to provide global political leadership towards a sustainable recovery post COVID-19 and to other global sustainable development processes, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such as by centering COVID-19 recovery plans around investments in nature and green jobs, sustainable finance, sound chemicals management, and sustainable production and consumption.

Ahead of the July 2020 session of the HLPF, the CPR agreed to submit the UNEA input developed through remote negotiations and silence procedure. The input to HLPF reports that: “January 2020 was the hottest month of January ever recorded, one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years and air pollution kills millions of people every year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that the world is currently facing, and its immediate aftermath, are likely to place additional strains on the environment.” Moreover, “the climate, biodiversity and chemicals crises have not disappeared [and] the world can ill-afford delays in key environment-related decision-making and investment.”

The UNEA recommends that the 2020 HLPF, among other items:

call for ambition in the 2020 environmental negotiations whose success will be crucial for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda including the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the international sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020;

stress that COVID-19 does not provide a “silver lining” for the environment but offers an opportunity for rebuilding the world better through green and sustainable recovery efforts, sound management of hazardous medical, and chemical waste and a clear commitment to “building back better”;

recognize the role of regional level coordination as key to address transboundary issues and facilitate regionally coherent approaches; and

acknowledge the request made to the UNEP Executive Director to develop a global environmental data strategy by 2025 and ask other UN entities to contribute to the strategy.

On commemorating the 50th anniversary of UNEP, in 2022, the Committee discussed Sweden’s offer to host a high-level political meeting in Stockholm to commemorate the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment. The CPR asked the UNEA secretariat to prepare a report on substantive aspects of preparations for the 50th anniversary.

In his statement to the 150th meeting, CPR Chair Fernando Coimbra (Brazil) said “the environmental agenda remains one of our most powerful insurance policies in preventing future global pandemics like COVID-19.” He added, “we have learnt the hard way that environmental protection is not a luxury,” but essential for growth and protection of vulnerable populations.

He highlighted that the COVID-19 medical emergency is resulting in a rapid increase in medical and hazardous waste. The UNEP framework ‘Towards a Pollution-Free Planet’ agreed at UNEA-4 provides support for Member States to address capacity gaps in medical waste systems in order to minimize possible secondary impacts on health and the environment.

The Chair also recalled that a “prescient” UNEP report from 2016 found that 60% of all known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. In other words, COVID-19 is just one of many diseases now known to have crossed between animals and humans. Currently, he said, UNEP is mapping the links between deteriorating ecosystem health, habitat and biodiversity loss, and over-exploitation of species. This will allow for policies to interrupt the zoonotic transmission pathways and provide “safe operating space” for nature, to prevent future pandemics.

Coimbra stressed that an ambitious, measurable and inclusive Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as The Beyond 2020 Chemicals and Waste Management Framework, because both play a central role in keeping nature intact, diverse and flourishing. Finally, he said the postponement of the next UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) is as an opportunity to strengthen NDCs by incorporating recovery efforts and climate-friendly investments to stimulate economies, build resilience, and create green and sustainable job opportunities.

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles.

The statement emphasizes the vulnerability of African countries to the negative impacts of climate change, calls on developed countries to agree on a path forward to close the climate finance gap in 2020, and stresses the importance of holding COP 27 in 2021.

Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, AGN Chair and Vice-President of the Bureau of COP/CMP/CMA, states that the AGN stands in solidarity with countries affected by COVID-19, and stresses the importance for all nations to continue to build momentum for ambitious climate action.

Gahouma-Bekale highlights 2020 as “an important year for the completion of the rules of the Paris Agreement and the Communication of revised and updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as well as the start of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.” He laments the postponement due to COVID-19 of many events which are crucial to building political momentum before the sessions of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies and COP 26.

The AGN emphasizes the urgency for all nations to take ambitious collective climate action at COP 26. Highlighting African countries’ particular vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the Group notes scientists have warned that the world has reached a “tipping point.”

The AGN calls on developed countries to close the climate finance gap by the end of 2020 despite the postponement of the COP, in line with the commitment by developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. However, the statement notes, a September 2019 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that developed countries provided only USD 71.2 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2017.

The AGN also maintains that the UNFCCC should hold COP 27 in Africa in 2021, as originally planned, stating that the timing of the COPs “must be linked to the urgent need of addressing the climate emergency.” [AGN Press Release] [SDG Knowledge Hub Sources]

123,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/virtual-g20-ministerial-events-spotlight-covid-19-trade-impacts/,"Tue, 12 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Virtual G20 Ministerial Events Spotlight COVID-19, Trade Impacts","Saudi Arabia, as holder of the Group of 20 (G20) Presidency, hosted a series of virtual G20 ministerial events in April 2020. While the meetings spanned energy, agriculture, digital economy, labor and employment, tourism, and trade and investment, the standout theme across all tracks was COVID-19, the impacts of the pandemic, and the G20’s response.

Meetings convened in the latter half of the month produced statements that focus exclusively on the issue, acknowledging COVID in the title. Several note that the respective groups of ministers stand ready to “convene again as necessary,” indicating that the pandemic and shift to a virtual meeting format may lead to more frequent discussions.

A Statement issued by the Trade and Investment Ministers of the G20 following their virtual meeting on 30 March describes COVID-19 as requiring “a coordinated global response.” It notes that the G20 Leaders, following their Extraordinary Meeting held on 26 March, committed “to presenting a united front against this common threat.” The Statement highlights the Ministers’ work to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies, agricultural products, and other essential goods and services across borders. It underscores concern for developing countries, emphasizing least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) and the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable workers and businesses. The Statement commits Trade and Investment Ministers “to work together to deliver a free, fair, nondiscriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment” and keep global supply chains functioning.

Trade impacts are also recognized in the Statement issued following the Extraordinary Agriculture Ministers Meeting held virtually on 21 April. The Ministers “acknowledge the challenges of minimizing the risk of COVID-19 while keeping food supply chains functioning.” They reaffirm the importance of “the continued flow of food, products, and inputs essential for agricultural and food production across borders.” They further agree – like the Trade and Investment Ministers – that emergency measures taken in response to COVID-19 must not create unnecessary barriers and must remain consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The Statement commits to reinforcing international cooperation and to guarding against unjustified restrictive measures that could lead to excessive food price volatility in international markets or threaten food security.

Emergency measures taken in response to COVID-19 must not create unnecessary barriers and must remain consistent with WTO rules.

A press release on the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting notes that while normally held in the margins of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group (WBG) Spring Meetings – on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is here – participants instead convened virtually on 15 April.

A Communiqué from the meeting summarizes the Group’s “urgent collective priority” as overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and “its intertwined health, social and economic impacts.” Measures taken by finance ministers and central bank governors include actions on fiscal and monetary stability, as well as ensuring that International Financial Institutions (IFIs) can provide support to developing and low-income countries. The Comminqué endorses the G20 Action Plan in response to COVID-19, including a financial response that, inter alia: delivers a comprehensive IMF support package; implements the support proposed by the WBG and multilateral development banks (MDBs) amounting to more than USD 200 billion; addresses debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries due to the pandemic; and enhances coordination among international organizations to maximize impact and optimize the use of resources.

Other meetings’ statements also link back to trade and the international disruption wrought by COVID-19:

The Extraordinary G20 Digital Economy Ministerial Meeting, held virtually on 30 April, released a COVID-19 Response Statement that emphasizes the role of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. The Statement highlights, inter alia, the importance of: communication infrastructure and network connectivity; secure data exchange; research and development of new health technologies; and the leveraging of digital technologies to promote international trade cooperation and maintain the stability of global supply chains, including through e-commerce and the digital supply of services.

The G20 Labor and Employment Ministers’ Statement on COVID-19 from the virtual meeting, held on 23 April, notes that workers are facing “elevated risks of job losses, reduced working hours, suspended employment relations and income loss” as a result of the pandemic. The Statement commits to a human-centered approach to promote employment, bolster social protection, stabilize labor relations, and ultimately minimize the impacts of COVID-19 on operations, resources, supply chains, and workforces.

The G20 Tourism Ministers’ Statement on COVID-19 from the virtual meeting, held on 24 April, estimates that a 45-70% decline in international tourism is expected for 2020, putting up to 75 million jobs at risk. The Ministers commit to working with relevant authorities “to ensure that the introduction and removal of travel restrictions are coordinated … and ensure the safety of travelers.” The Statement welcomes efforts by other working groups and further commits to “fostering innovation and digital technologies that enable sustainable practices and seamless travel.”

The G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting Statement from the virtual meeting, held on 24 April, laments that COVID-19 has “contributed to the destabilization of global oil and gas markets and compromises energy security for many nations.” The Ministers “recognize the vital role that well-functioning, stable, open, transparent and competitive energy markets play” in economic activity, and commit to ensuring “the uninterrupted flow of energy.”

In addition to the above statements’ calls for action on COVID-19, the Saudi G20 Presidency called for USD 8 billion, and pledged USD 500 million, to fight the pandemic.

Southeast Asia is the world’s “most polluting region” for ocean plastics, as noted by ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. The region’s fast-growing cities, in particular, contribute approximately 60% of plastic waste leakage into the environment. The pollution originates from uncollected waste and leakages in municipal waste management systems.

Local governments will use digital tools to identify waste generation “hot spots.”

Launched on 5 May 2020, the ‘Closing the Loop’ project, which is supported by the Government of Japan, will help to build the capacity of ASEAN cities to plan for and manage their plastic waste using circular economy principles. The pilot cities are: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand and Da Nang, Viet Nam.

First, a digital tool will help local governments monitor plastic waste leakage and identify “hot spots” for waste generation. The tool will use remote sensing, satellite and crowdsourced data applications to produce plastic waste maps and simulations.

Second, the project will provide training and tools for policymakers to develop policy and investment strategies that apply a “circular economy” approach in managing their plastic waste streams.

The project will support local implementation of two intergovernmental frameworks: the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris; and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, which was introduced during Japan’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) in 2019. The Osaka Vision is a commitment by G20 leaders to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050.

The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and other partners will collaborate with ESCAP and Japan to implement the project with local and national governments in Southeast Asia.

The event provided the opportunity for AOSIS members and others to highlight synergies between the disruption of COVID-19 and climate change, and the ways in which responses to the pandemic support more sustainable climate action and ambition in the lead up to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC and beyond.

The Placencia Ambition Forum convened virtually from 20-22 April 2020, and was hosted by the Government of Belize, which is currently serving as AOSIS Chair.

The Forum made the case for accelerating inclusive, green transitions, with COVID-19 magnifying the importance of the priorities of small island developing States (SIDS) for the global climate change agenda. For example, reduced use of transport and energy demand due to the pandemic show that change is possible.

Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that retreating on climate action in the face of the pandemic is not an option given that the social and economic devastation caused by climate disruption will be exponentially greater than the COVID-19 crisis. He emphasized the need to “build back better” from the pandemic and use the recovery from COVID-19 impacts to ensure a more sustainable and resilient future. He said he will continue to advocate for debt relief, including for middle-income countries (MICs), to enable SIDS to survive both the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change.

Others also reiterated their support for SIDS. For example, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) committed to work on innovative financial structuring to ensure that stimulus packages do not compound the debt burden faced by SIDS, and to improve access to finance, especially in response to the pandemic.



The Forum reiterated that the intersecting climate and COVID-19 crises require actions that simultaneously address both challenges, with stimulus packages and other COVID-19 responses that are aligned with climate targets and that enable transition to greener, cleaner, and more resilient societies. For example, expanding renewable energy capacity in SIDS and least developed countries (LDCs) is consistent with efforts to enhance the sustainable water and energy supply required for medical purposes.

The Forum resulted in a Declaration titled, ‘2020 – Our Year of Ambition,’ which calls for:

ambitious, detailed, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that will close the gap between where we are now and where we need to be to limit global warming to 1.5°C;

new financial commitments that deliver on support and reflect ambition, including deeper discussions at COP 26 on the long-term finance goal to provide certainty for more ambitious mid- to long-term climate actions; and

enhanced near-term action to protect the vulnerable, including short-term action and domestic reform within the context of building long-term resilience.

The Declaration also urges countries to follow through with COVID-19 recovery plans that incorporate policies and measures that help jump start NDC implementation and lead to enhanced ambition and action. It calls for a ‘Roadmap for Political Momentum’ towards COP 26, and welcomes the Group of 20 (G20) commitment to use the SDGs and other international commitments to guide recovery from COVID-19.

The Declaration explains that the health and climate crises both reveal vulnerabilities to systemic shocks and demand unprecedented transitions to “flatten their respective curves and drive an exponential shift in their trajectories.” The Declaration calls for 2020 to be “the year of ambition,” beginning with plans to change emission trajectories towards achieving 1.5°C.

The Forum fed into the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which recognized efforts of the Placencia Ambition Forum to maintain the momentum in addressing climate change despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

126,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-charts-businesses-path-through-covid-19-crisis/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ITC Charts Businesses’ Path Through COVID-19 Crisis,"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a 15-point action plan to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSMEs, the action plan notes, are “the driving force behind” many essential services in the pandemic. However, they are also particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of the crisis, especially in developing and transition economies. Beyond facing weaker consumer confidence and being overrepresented in the hardest-hit sectors such as retail trade, tourism, and personal and professional services, MSMEs have fewer assets, reduced access to credit, and a more challenging trade environment relative to large companies.

The plan for MSMEs is centered around five recommendations for businesses, five for business support organizations, and five for governments. An ITC news release featuring a consolidated set of recommendations reminds the reader in each of the three sections to both “prepare your immediate response to the crisis” and to “get ready for the ‘new normal’.”

Free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food.

The plan’s introduction highlights that the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates a decline in cross-border investment flows by up to 30-40% in 2020-2021. Accordingly, trade aspects feature prominently throughout the action plan, and are especially strong in the section for governments, though the plan emphasizes that governments, business support organizations, and small business alike should coordinate the immediate response in a collaborative manner. The plan calls on governments to implement support measures built around concessional financing, tax reductions and grants, employment incentives, and targeted interventions.

Resisting the allure of trade protectionism is paramount, the plan argues. It emphasizes that free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food. Thus, the plan also recommends that governments facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services, and streamline the movement of essential products by following best practices as outlined in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Actions include, inter alia: certificates for medical equipment and essential food items; enhanced border management coordination, for example between customs and sanitary authorities; special regimes for expedited clearance of certain goods; and accelerating clearance processes for trusted traders or authorized economic operators who respect health-related rules and regulations.

The plan also notes that governments can expand and facilitate access to trade finance for MSMEs, including those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The pandemic, the plan notes, has negatively impacted the availability of trade finance for small business due to higher liquidity costs and the perceived risk of short-term finance, leaving a void for governments to fill. The document notes that several economies have expanded short-term programmes that provide financial support to national exporters. Flagging that nearly all MSMEs rely on goods that have been sourced internationally, the plan stresses that now more than ever is the time “to conserve the links between small businesses and international markets.”

The plan underscores that trade documents and procedures can be digitalized in collaboration with the private sector, noting that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement encourages countries to introduce digital clearance processes. As noted above, such processes can simplify cross-border trade whilst limiting physical contact and in-person interactions. While the plan points to the private sector as having responsibility for digitalizing trade documents, it acknowledges that the onus is on governments to provide legal certainty that these documents will be recognized within their respective jurisdictions.

From large broadcasters and established print media, to news agencies, radio stations and newer digital publishers, the SDG Media Compact spans 160 countries on five continents, reaching a combined audience of about 2 billion people through well over one hundred outlets owned by Compact members.



“Media play a crucial role in countering misinformation and galvanizing action for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis based on science, solidarity and our common roadmap, the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Melissa Fleming, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications. “We are proud to have one hundred SDG Media Compact members from across the globe, committed to covering the critical issues of our time and driving progress toward a healthier and more peaceful world.”



The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by world leaders in 2015, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030. UN expert voices, data, reports and stories are regularly shared with SDG Media Compact members, inspiring coverage of the Goals without interfering in editorial freedom. As part of the UN’s new Verified initiative, Compact members will also be receiving trusted and accurate content about COVID-19 to counter misinformation and flood the internet and airwaves with content on science, solutions and solidarity.



For Sky Group, Europe’s leading media and entertainment company, being part of the SDG Media Compact means acting on the big global issues that matter. “We’ve aligned our strategy with the Sustainable Development Goals because they provide clear purpose to ensure business drives the change that is crucial to improving our world,” said Jeremy Darroch, Sky Group’s CEO.



Shanghai Media Group, one of the newest members, joined the Compact to be part of a global alliance working toward common goals. “It is our sincere wish to work closely with global media organizations to jointly build a community of shared future for mankind,” said Chairwoman Jianjun Wang.



For ATTN:, a digital publisher based in the United States, “partnering with the United Nations and having the ability to tap into their expert voices and data helps us ensure that our storytelling is well-sourced and informational, giving human interest stories the power to have real impact,” said Charlie Goldensohn, Senior Strategist at ATTN:.



“In a digital world full of misinformation and fake news, credibility is vital, and that is what we have greatly gained through our partnership with the SDG Media Compact and the rich editorial content shared,” said Maikem Emmanuela Manzie on behalf of Ndefcam radio in Cameroon. “The free flow of information on current issues, especially on COVID-19, has helped in building our stories on how the community can better fight this new virus.”



Many members have already played a crucial role in countering misinformation, disseminating science-based information to fight the virus, and covering the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 in the context of the broader sustainable development agenda.



SBS Australia examined how and why conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus are spreading so quickly. Sky News debunked the conspiracy theory linking 5G radio antennas to the coronavirus. Noticias Positivas reported on the issue of fake news related to the pandemic. ATTN: launched a digital literacy series focused on helping young people distinguish fact from fiction on COVID-related content. And the Asahi Shimbun explained why antagonizing the World Health Organization won’t bring the world closer to containing the virus.



On the socio-economic front, Euronews, in an interview with the UN Secretary-General, called attention to the need for global solidarity for the world to emerge stronger from the crisis. CGTN published a number of pieces calling for debt relief for the poorest nations. The Nikkei reported on the need for mental health services as an essential part of the COVID-19 response. And Prensa Latina disseminated the Secretary-General’s call to protect the well-being of children.



On environmental matters, the Jakarta Post was among the outlets that amplified the UN Secretary-General’s call for a green recovery from the pandemic, SBS looked at how COVID-19 could be a chance to green our economies, In Depth News explained how ecosystems and human health intersect, and Scientific American reported on the crisis’ impact on CO2 emissions and implications for a green recovery.



Looking at the gender dimensions, the Mainichi amplified the UN Secretary-General’s call to address the pandemic’s consequences for women and girls. Devex, in an interview with UN Women, highlighted the outsized impacts of the crisis on women’s work, health, and livelihoods. And Sky aired the UN Secretary-General’s message urging governments to prioritize the prevention and redress of violence against women in their COVID response plans.

County elected officials and staff are taking part in the Regional Emergency Response Council’s program to pack and deliver 1,500 food hampers for seniors in Cornwall and the United Counties who can’t leave their homes.

The United Way/Centraide of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry and the members of the Regional Emergency Response Council were awarded $100,343.00, funded by the Government of Canada’s New Horizons for Seniors Program. The New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP) provides grants and contributions for projects that help improve the well-being of seniors and foster their social inclusion.

“We’re thrilled to be helping our partners to ensure that our most vulnerable are able to access food while remaining in lockdown,” said SDG Warden Frank Prevost, who joined his daughters in packing food hampers Thursday at the Benson Centre in Cornwall. “We also support other ongoing efforts to help our seniors and ensure they have access to programming to ease the burden of the coronavirus pandemic.”

County library staff have offered the use of its large delivery truck to help cart food hampers to strategic locales in SDG where the material is dispersed to those in need. Many local agencies, non-profits and charitable organizations such as the County, Carefor, Seaway Valley Community Health Centre, the City of Cornwall and the Service Clubs of Cornwall to expand the offer related to food access.

If you are a senior and need help accessing food during this crisis, a centralized phone referral program, which begins with a call to 2-1-1, will best guide them to the services that they may need during this crisis. A team of professionals will answer questions and ensure individuals are referred to the right food service, be it Foodbank, grocery delivery, Meals on Wheels, or the new emergency food hamper program that best fits current needs.","The United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry is pitching in to help a program that is feeding area seniors who have been shut-in as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAN) is preparing to open the region’s first virtual farmers market in collaboration with the City of Cornwall, United Counties of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry, United Counties of Prescott Russell, and several local farmers markets.

“We know residents across the region are looking to buy local food and support our many local producers,” said Alain D’Aoust, coordinator for the Eastern Ontario Agri-food Network. “By developing the virtual farmers market, coordinating local distribution to consumers, and promoting on behalf of all vendors, we believe this effort will be a win-win for everyone.”

The virtual farmers market is being developed using Local Line, a uniquely designed e-commerce tool for producers and agri-food vendors. The new website will feature a unique online store for each vendor, as well as a shared market store offering products from all 100 vendors. Consumers will be able to buy from any number of vendors at once, select the preferred delivery option, and pay online using a single point check-out. The software will immediately notify the vendor of the sale, identify the delivery point, and transfer the payment automatically.

“We wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone,” said D’Aoust. “Consumers will be able to order from a full catalogue of products, manage their delivery options, and easily pay online.”

The EOAN plans to waive the monthly administrative fee from now until September.

“Thanks to sponsorship from local partners and surplus funds from last year’s Eastern Ontario Local Food Conference, we are able to focus our time on getting local producers online before the summer season without presenting any additional cost to their bottom line” said D’Aoust.

The formal vendor application will open at www.agro-on.ca on Tuesday, May 19.

Residents living in Cornwall and SDG long-term care homes are now being tested for COVID-19.

Members of the Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services’ COVID-19 response team are conducting the tests in the many homes throughout the week. The COVID-19 Response Team is made up of 18 paramedics, including three community paramedics, all of whom can be deployed in three separate response units.

“Paramedics have been testing vulnerable residents for COVID-19 through the Community Paramedicine Program since the beginning of the pandemic,” said Chief Bill Lister. “Paramedics who volunteered to be part of the response team received additional training and will proactively test groups identified by the Eastern Ontario Health Unit.”

The response team is testing staff members and residents in long-term care homes, as part of a provincewide initiative to proactively test residents in vulnerable areas, and can test other paramedics who become symptomatic.

“I’m proud to know paramedics are leading the way with proactive testing,” said Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement. “When we ask you to stay home, wash your hands, and respect restrictions, it’s with frontline workers like paramedics in mind. Together we are helping keep them safe while they do the essential work of testing for COVID-19.”

Cornwall-SDG Paramedics also decided to pay it forward to the Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU), after having received lunches from St. Joseph’s Continuing Care Centre.

On Friday, the paramedics, in partnership with CUPE Local 5734, donated lunches to EOHU staff members.

“Paramedics have felt so much support from our community in recent months,” said Lister. “In partnership with the union, our service is proud to be able to pay it forward.”

Deliveries were made safely, with physical distancing and a minimum number of staff involved.

“Paramedics have also challenged the Health Unit to pay it forward,” concluded Lister, a challenge the EOHU quickly accepted on Facebook.","Article contentResidents living in Cornwall and SDG long-term care homes are now being tested for COVID-19.

The top 12 nominated entrepreneurs will be able to pitch their products and solutions at the Summit, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021 during the Building Bridges Week and will get support to access strategic partners to scale up their venture.

According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.) to nominate from their own pipelines, up to 3 entrepreneurs which meet the eligibility criteria. Self nomination is not be accepted. The call will remain open till 15 July.

The call is for growth stage impact ventures for SDGs aimed at identifying and showcasing mature impact ventures in emerging countries with the catalytic potential to drive both large impact and yield sustainable profit.

The UNDP said 2020 the Call for Nominations only accepts Post Series A impact ventures providing products and services which reduce inequalities (with particular attention to gender inequalities) by providing solutions that empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to access to quality health, affordable and clean energy, and by reducing and recovering waste. Only ventures with headquarters, primary workforce and service provision or product market in developing countries can be eligible for the selection.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

In 2019, 76 third-parties submitted 119 proposals from 40 developing countries. Eighty-five percent of the nominated ventures had raised at least half a million dollars at the time of nomination, and closed their Series A. All 12 finalists were mid-sized, with an average of up to 50 employees, annual revenue of over US$3 million, and with a cumulative impact on more than 15 million lives through their products and services.

The UN Joint SDG Fund (the Fund) supports countries as they accelerate their progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Fund operates through a series of calls for the United Nations (UN) system that lead to the implementation of transformative Joint Programmes (JPs), under the leadership of Resident Coordinators (RCs). In doing so, the Fund is committed to forge paths and partnerships that unlock public and private capital for the SDGs at scale. All allocations made by the Fund will be in the form of grants to UN agencies.

This call operationalizes the following “Terms of Reference” of the Fund:

● Reinforce the SDG financing architecture (Component 1): The Fund will support UN Country Teams in the development of financing strategies and enabling frameworks for SDG investment. This work will include the strengthening of the capacities of the national and sub-national SDG financing architecture, piloting of integrated national financing frameworks, establishment of partnerships through convening networks and consortia comprised of actors from the public and private sector and the production of SDG-aligned financing strategies.

● Catalyze strategic investments (Component 2): The Fund will support UN Country Teams in investing in key initiatives that leverage public and private financing in order to advance the SDGs. These initiatives will provide a demonstration of concept and will be scalable both in country and elsewhere.

FINANCING THE AGENDA 2030: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

World leaders have made ambitious commitments to achieve the SDGs. Yet, securing enough resources remains a major challenge, with developing countries facing a gap estimated between US$2.5–3 trillion per year. Financing is theoretically available, given the size, scale and level of sophistication of the global financial system—with gross world product and global gross financial assets estimated at over US$85 trillion and US$ 200 trillion respectively. While the world has never been as rich as it is today, financial flows and wealth, mostly private, do not (or cannot) reach the geographies and people that need them the most.

There is no lack of opportunities to fill the gap and reorient public and private investment towards the SDGs.

SDGs are being increasingly integrated into public budgets and development cooperation. Despite growing concerns on public debts, the median tax revenue is growing in the developing world: 80 countries have reported an increase in their tax-to-GDP ratios in 2017. The digitalization of finance—or fintech—has opened new venues at a speed unimageable at the beginning of the new millennium.

Not only Governments, but also the financial markets and investors have positively reacted, by starting to demand and claim a stronger integration of the SDGs in public and private investment decisions. Commitments were supported by increasing evidence that investing in the SDGs makes economic sense, with an estimated US$12 trillion of market opportunities. Responsible investment strategies, from exclusion lists to impact investing, have grown to US$30.7 trillion in 2018. New markets and asset classes have emerged: the green bond market increased from virtually zero in 2010 to over US$200 billion in 2019. Despite opportunities, bottlenecks and intensified risks—from vulnerability to climate change and economic recessions to health epidemics—persist. Most private investments are not channeled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed required. SDG investment opportunities in many countries, such as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and fragile countries are underinvested.

Private investments in SDG-related infrastructure in developing countries were lower in 2018 than in 2012. The financing for the 2030 agenda is constrained by a range of challenges, including:

• Limited fiscal space and institutional capacity to formulate a pipeline of bankable SDG investment projects, and weak public finance management systems, notably in countries most at risk of being left behind.

• Weak tax collection systems and underperforming public finance management that result in reduced revenue generation and lower performance and budget execution, thus limiting the available space for increasing SDG-relating spending.

• Misaligned incentives and regulations, limited awareness, and difficulties in identifying, measuring and reporting on sustainable investments, which impede private investment in the SDGs at scale.

• Public planning and SDG-aligned strategies remain de-linked from financing and budgeting, leading to less effective spending and poor service delivery. The same strategies are also not designed to attract different sources of financing, including from the private and financial sectors.

• There is often a mismatch between what private “capital” wants and needs and the environment and bankability of businesses and projects that impact the SDGs.

• The lack of common definitions, impact measurement standards and rigorous frameworks for reporting are challenging the way impact is measured.","THE JOINT SDG FUNDThe UN Joint SDG Fund (the Fund) supports countries as they accelerate their progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations.

Finland is one of 47 countries that will present a VNR during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report, which was released by the Prime Minister’s Office, covers all 17 Goals and 169 targets of the SDG framework. It focuses on progress achieved between 2016 and 2020, and summarizes key changes and lessons learned regarding: methodology for preparing the VNR; policy and enabling environment; and means of implementation.

As noted in the foreword by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, preparation of Finland’s 2020 VNR introduced new approaches for “intensified stakeholder participation,” with several stakeholders providing their own assessment of progress. Progress on each SDG is presented in the report through two assessments: one from government officials, covering all targets; and another from civil society, providing an overall assessment of progress as well as recommendations for further progress.

The preparation process also included peer review, with the Governments of Mozambique and Switzerland reviewing the draft report and sharing their views.

At the national level, Finland’s VNR notes that a sustainability assessment has been integrated into the annual cycle of policy planning, budgeting and reporting. Environmental aspects have been easier to integrate into policy than social aspects, the report reveals.

The VNR also reflects SDG localization in Finland, noting that cities’ engagement in implementing the 2030 Agenda has increased, and three cities have prepared Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). In addition, the autonomous region of Åland has integrated the SDGs into its core strategies.

The report provides an update on two major features of Finland’s approach to sustainable development – the circular economy, and the ‘Society’s Commitment to Sustainable Development 2050.’ On circular economy, after creating the world’s first roadmap to a circular economy in 2016, its objective is now to “bring the circular economy to the core of competitiveness and economic growth strategy, transition to low-carbon energy, start considering natural resources as a scarcity and promote the shift to a sustainable lifestyle.” Per the national roadmap, Finland aims to be a leading nation in circular economy by 2025.

On the Society’s Commitment, the report describes the tool enabling anyone in Finland to register a concrete action towards the SDGs, and reports that as of March 2020 over 2,000 commitments are listed, with private companies, schools and individual citizens being the most active partners. The latest version of the platform allows users to calculate their personal carbon footprint, draw up a personal plan to reduce their footprint, and track their contribution to the national emissions reduction target.

Looking forward, the government notes that:

A national implementation plan for 2020-2025 will be submitted to the Parliament later in 2020;

In 2021, Finland will prepare a national 2030 Agenda Roadmap, to support a “systemic, long-term approach” to sustainability transformations;

The Government will commission an evaluation of national sustainable development policy in 2023;

Finland is striving for carbon neutrality by 2035; and

Finland is preparing a long-term national roadmap for increasing Finland’s Official Development Aid to 0.7% of GNI; the report notes that Finland has not yet been able to restore ODA to the level preceding budget cuts in 2016.

The government indicates that it will present its next VNR to the HLPF in 2025.

The 2020 session of the HLPF will convene from 7-16 July, most likely in an entirely virtual format. All side events and exhibitions will take place virtually. The latest programme was released on 14 May 2020.

Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.

On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated “elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.

Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.

According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.

The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.

Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).

Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:

Summit on Biodiversity (proposed to reschedule to 30 September);

High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); and

High-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).

The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.

In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.

A shared understanding could help ensure a meaningful contribution to the SDGs and hold companies accountable for the social and environmental behavior, the authors argue.

The policy brief released on 28 May 2020 titled, ‘How can investors move from greenwashing to SDG-enabling?,’ observes that companies must help build a sustainable world, which they need in order to preserve their long-term financial performance. However, investors may lack tools to measure activity and hold companies accountable. A common definition of Sustainable Development Investment (SDI) would establish norms and minimum thresholds to qualify as aligned with sustainable development. The authors note that the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance launched in October 2019 is working on a shared understanding of sustainable investing.

The time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.

A common definition would need to be followed by strengthened reporting requirements. Regulatory frameworks would “enable a proper assessment of corporate contribution to the SDGs, but also penalize unsustainable practices and discourage short-term thinking in capital markets.”

The brief notes that the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, prepared by over 60 international agencies from the UN system and beyond, recommended the adoption of global mandatory disclosures on climate-related financial risk like those promoted by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The authors also identify three challenges to sustainability reporting by companies. First, its voluntary nature: “the time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.” Second, the quality and absence of meaningful KPIs that connect to the SDGs; only 23% of multinational companies’ sustainability reports connect the SDGs to numerical performance indicators, and “without numbers, sustainability reporting quickly becomes a public relations exercise.” Third, the variety in type of information, which makes it hard to compare different companies’ data.

Finally, the brief notes that Canada has pioneered an approach in which companies receiving financial assistance for crises like the COVID-19 pandemic must commit to stricter reporting requirements on socioeconomic issues, as well as carbon reduction targets.

The brief is part of a series aimed at helping policy makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series has also addressed the impacts of the pandemic on youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, and indigenous peoples, and how it is affecting physical activity and wellbeing; and accountability at the national level and the relationships between States and people, among other topics.

By the latest version of the text, the UNGA would specify eight SDGs for in-depth review during the 2021 session of the HLPF, and hold more forward-looking discussions during the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021).

Kaha Imnadze (Georgia) and Jean-Claude do Rego (Benin), co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations for the review process of ECOSOC and HLPF, explain that they focused the revised draft only on 2021 partly in order to “bridge the gap between the positions of delegations.”

The co-facilitators released the zero draft of the resolution on 24 April, which proposed themes, SDGs, and “areas for acceleration” to be discussed at the next three HLPF session (2021, 2022, and 2023). By that draft, SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnership for the Goals) would be reviewed each year. Member States discussed the zero draft on 8 May, and several delegations subsequently submitted written inputs: Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, the Group of 77 and China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The revised version of the text, dated 8 June, now identifies SDGs for review only during the 2021 session of the HLPF. Preambular paragraphs in the revised draft note that the COVID-19 pandemic poses threats to sustainable development, including in the areas of health and the world economy, and that the poorest and most vulnerable people are the most affected. This hampers progress towards the SDGs. The introductory text continues, “implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial to help better equip the world for future systemic shocks,” and the SDGs provide a “blueprint” for recovery that leaves no one behind.

The revised draft proposes that the 2021 theme for ECOSOC and HLPF would be ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action.’ The 2021 HLPF would take up three “areas of acceleration”: health and human well-being; sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies; and healthy nutrition patterns.

In-depth reviews would be held on several SDGs – “namely, but not limited to” the eight SDGs most closely associated with these areas: Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and wellbeing), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals). The in-depth reviews will address interlinkages between the SDGs to promote actions that “create co-benefits, address synergies and trade-offs, and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.” They would also account for the impacts of COVID-19 on the SDGs.

By the revised draft resolution, the UNGA would decide to conduct the reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF during its 75th session, which begins in September 2020. The informal meetings for the review would be open to major groups and other relevant stakeholders.

Discussions during the 75th session also would define the themes for the HLPF and ECOSOC sessions in 2022 and 2023.

A virtual consultation will convene on 15 June for a paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the revised text.

In the wake of the crisis, visibility and urgency on issues such as climate change, income inequality and human rights have risen and the five-step framework seeks to support investors in creating investment outcomes that are aligned with the UN goals, the PRI said in its report.

It comes as the investor organisation, with $89trn (€78trn) in assets managed by its signatories, has registered an increase in its members mentioning the SDGs in their reporting, with 650 in 2020, compared to 418 last year.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that meeting the 17 SDGs by 2030 will require $5trn to $7trn per year from the private sector, the PRI report said.

To support the SDGs, investors need to increase the positive outcomes and decrease the negative outcomes of their actions.

Investors need to redirect existing capital and engage with investees to improve positive outcomes.

The PRI report states that there is a continuous feedback cycle between environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities and (SDG-aligned) outcomes, shaped by investor actions (see figure 2 below).

This applies particularly for ‘universal owners’, who are long-term investors and so large that they hold a slice of the overall market.

“For such investors, overall economic performance will influence the future value of their portfolios more than the performance of individual companies or sectors, incentivising them to support sustainable growth and well-functioning financial markets,” the report noted.

Focusing on SDG outcomes allows investors to, for example:

identify opportunities, such as through changes to business models, across supply chains and through new and expanded products and services;

prepare for and respond to legal and regulatory developments, including those that may lead to asset stranding; and

protect their reputation and licence-to-operate (eg the trust of beneficiaries, clients and other stakeholders), particularly in the event of negative outcomes from investments.

The framework follows previous work by the PRI on the SDG investment case in 2017 and is the starting point for more work on the subject. It will also be the basis for future guidance and support, the report explained.

Next steps

Going forward, the PRI will work with signatories, who seek to shape outcomes in line with the SDGs, to provide best practices and develop a consensus on how to address common challenges, it said.

The PRI will also include an initial set of questions on shaping real-world outcomes in the pilot year of its new reporting framework in 2021.

Junko Nakagawa, president and chief executive of Nomura Asset Management, commented: “It is clear that large asset managers have a crucial role to play in supporting outcomes in line with the SDGs through both investments in equities and engagement with publicly-listed companies.

“Whilst we recognise the difficulties associated with pursuing impact through public investing for certain SDG targets, large public companies are among the most important stakeholders for achieving success. These companies have the resources, scale and investment power to bridge the huge funding gaps, while major asset managers are uniquely positioned to engage with these companies and help to enhance their impact.”

Darryl Murphy, managing director, infrastructure at Aviva Investors, said: “As long-term investors, we believe infrastructure – and real assets more broadly – have a critical role to play in moving towards a truly sustainable future.

“[The SDGs] help us to define objectives for a project and shape terms and conditions of an investment agreement, ensuring that borrowers adhere to certain practices and standards over the long-term.”

During a silence procedure for his election, it was announced that a secret ballot had been requested. The vote by secret ballot will take place on 17 June in the UNGA Hall.

According to the Assembly’s practice of regional rotation among Member States, the President for UNGA 75 is to be selected from the Western European and Other States Group (WEOG). In February 2020, the Group endorsed Bozkir as candidate for the 2020-2021 presidency. Bozkir is a former Member of Parliament in Turkey and former Minister for EU Affairs.

According to his vision statement for the 75th session, Bozkir pledges to support implementation of the UN reform agenda and the 2020 vision of the UN Secretary-General. He indicates that he will prioritize three issues:

Underlining the irreplaceable nature of the rules-based international system and the importance of multilateralism, taking advantage of the UN’s 75th anniversary;

Addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, people in need, and people under oppression, such as refugees, immigrants, and stateless persons, and ensuring delivery of humanitarian assistance and respect for international humanitarian law; and

Focusing on SDG implementation in countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs).

His vision statement also expresses support for the Secretary-General’s objective of achieving gender parity at all levels at the UN. Bozkir highlights the UNGA’s high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held on 23 September 2020 in the margins of the 75th general debate.

A virtual dialogue between the candidate and Member States took place on 15 May 2020. On 27 May the current UNGA President, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande commenced a silence procedure for Member States to elect Bozkir. Silence procedure has been used to take UNGA decisions while in-person meetings are not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, on 2 June Muhammad-Bande announced that a request had been made for a vote via secret ballot. The vote will take place on 17 June, simultaneously with the election of non-permanent members of the UN Security Council and members of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

To conduct the secret ballot, each UN Member State will register one representative to enter the UNGA Hall at a designated time to cast their ballot. Muhammad-Bande will oversee the proceedings in the Hall, and the election tellers will observe the election and certify the result.

More information on the procedure is provided in a letter to Member States. [Volkan Bozkir Biography]","During a silence procedure for his election, it was announced that a secret ballot had been requested.

The studies also present trends and perspectives for transitioning to safe alternatives.

The studies show that these countries have all experienced an increasing trend in the use of HHPs, which can permanently undermine human health and affect future generations. HHP poisoning can lead to chronic disability or death. An overall summary of the studies provides a snapshot of each country’s HHP use.

The Russia study highlights: partial contamination of land and adjacent environments with harmful substances due to long-term use of HHPs and agrochemicals in agriculture and forestry; challenges ensuring environmental safety due to a lack of effective state supervision over the safe handling of pesticides and agrochemicals in agricultural production; and environmental pollution in areas where obsolete and banned pesticides are stored.

In Armenia, more than 60% of pesticides allowed by legislation are HHPs, with one third of them categorized as carcinogens or possible carcinogens.

Many pesticides registered and officially used in Kazakhstan contain one or more active ingredients from the HHP list. The study from explains that, as of March 2019, 74 active ingredients belonging to HHPs are used in Kazakhstan, with 25 of the active ingredients banned in other countries. Of the 1,021 trade names of pesticides registered in Kazakhstan, 386 contain one or more active HHP substance.

In Uzbekistan, 59 HHPs are allowed for use, 34 of which are banned in other countries. Uzbekistan has established a database of laws and regulations governing the production, use, injury, and liability of individuals and legal entities and the sound management of chemicals, including the registration, licensing, and prevention of stockpiling of hazardous chemicals.

In Ukraine, the study concludes that among 3,966 preparatory forms of pesticides, 1,125 formulations contain one to three active ingredients of HHPs. Thus, around one third of pesticides and agrochemicals allowed for use in Ukraine are HHPs. Eighty-three active ingredients of HHPs in preparative forms of pesticides and agrochemicals are allowed for use in Ukraine, 41 of which are already prohibited in other countries.

Recommendations include: reducing and eventually eliminating HHPs in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia through increased information on safe HHP substitution, including use of the ecosystem-based approach and traditional knowledge in agriculture; and Regional Focal Points to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) collecting lessons learned from this process and sharing them with national officials to facilitate the switch from HHPs to safer alternatives.

The executive summaries are in English, while the full reports are provided in Russian. The studies were undertaken as a part of IPEN’s Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign, which focuses on international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral cooperation to support chemical safety and sound chemicals management and waste objectives beyond 2020. The Campaign contends that advancing chemical safety is necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It seeks to engage civil society organizations to further advance its objectives.

The studies are related to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land).

IPEN Participating Organizations have been undertaking activities related to the Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign since 2018. Activities address agroecology, chemicals in products, endocrine disrupting chemicals or POPs, hazardous chemicals in the lifecycle of electronics, HHPs, lead in paint, women and chemicals, workplace right-to-know, and/or zero waste issues.

The UN SDGs are an urgent universal call for action to change the world and steer it towards a better and more sustainable path. One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

What are the SDGs?

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 following decades of work by countries and the UN and were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015. They replaced the Millennium Development Goals, which started a global effort in 2000 to address poverty.

The UN Development Programme supports countries in implementing and achieving the SDGs through integrated solutions. Because of their global nature, achieving the SDGs requires the establishment of global partnerships, including governments, private actors, civil society, and citizens. Moreover, creativity, technology, and financial resources from all of society are necessary to achieve the SDGs.

The need for the 18th SDG

Planet Earth and the human race are strongly connected to each other. Sustainability of this planet is something that can be achieved from on Earth but also from outer space. Natural disasters and other phenomena that can lead to the extinction of the human race in the long term can be observed from outer space through satellites that provide essential information.

As public and private interest in the quest for exploration and use of outer space increases, the UN can spread awareness on issues that would protect humanity and the outer space ecosystem.

With the development of counter-space technologies and ‘space forces’ by several nations, a constant need exists for the protection of space against military use. Space, although infinite, is a scarce resource due to the limited availability of orbital space near Earth and in view of orbital congestion and space debris, there is a need for the protection and sustainability of space for future generations. Any set of SDGs without a focus on environmental impact would be incomplete. Formulating guidelines on environmental compliance reporting will go a long way to protect the outer space environment. A new SDG 18 could also address how data obtained about new celestial bodies in the process of commercial exploration is shared for the benefit of humanity.

Remote sensing satellites providing data for monitoring land use, soil, drought, crop development, water cycles, and other aspects of the natural environment, as well as the epidemiology of infectious diseases, are vital for addressing the problems incorporated in the SDGs on hunger, poverty, sanitation, energy, life on land and life below water. While the SDGs on quality education, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, are addressed by telecommunication technologies enabled by satellite communication, the unique opportunities for partnerships and collaborations in space foster cooperation vital for ‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’ (SDG 16). Therefore, it could be said that SDG 18 would not only be a sustainable development goal itself but also a catalyst for all the other 17 SDGs!

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’ – Stephen Hawking

Initiating space as the 18th SDG

Placing space on the UN SDGs agenda has already seen several initiatives. In a joint report published by UNOOSA and the European GNSS Agency in January 2018, global cooperation and recognition of the ability of space to support the SDGs were recognised as a key for the success of the UN SDGs.

Additionally, The National Space Society, a US organisation for space advocacy, calls for ‘Recognizing the Imperative Role of Space in our Future’ as the 18th SDG. According to the NSS, the sustainable development of space economy must be recognised as a development goal that will include the principles of space exploration and utilisation, and the development of space communities.

Finally, a group of students from the Windesheim Honours College in Zwolle, the Netherlands, calls for the recognition of SDG 18: ‘Space for all’ by emphasising the responsibility of humanity for the bigger system beyond Earth. Their work introduces four pillars for that goal: respect and care for the community of life in our galaxy and universe; ecological wisdom and integrity towards biological systems in space; social and economic justice towards other planets and their resources; and global commitment to democracy, nonviolence, and peace towards potential new forms of life.

It is clear that space plays a crucial part in the achievement of the existing 17 SDGs. However, as the reliance on space to meet these goals is growing, space sustainability should be recognised as a goal in itself. As Stephen Hawking stated:

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’","One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

The post-2020 approach to international chemicals management had been scheduled to be adopted during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020. The pandemic caused the postponement of the final preparatory meeting for ICCM5 a few weeks before it was scheduled to take place at the end of March 2020, along with the postponement of ICCM5 itself. Both events are now expected to take place in 2021.

During a webinar organized by the Geneva Environment Network to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sound management of chemicals and waste, Nalini Sharma, SAICM Secretariat, noted that the Strategic Approach’s work is connected to the pandemic, particularly through the issue of waste management. She highlighted challenges for SAICM Beyond 2020, including linkages to other agendas, such as biodiversity and climate change. She added that a discussion on linkages between the SAICM Beyond 2020 and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework processes includes identifying activities for better coordination between the two clusters.

Three options for the rescheduled preparatory meeting were identified by Valentina Sierra, Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN in Geneva. One option under consideration is early March 2021 in Bucharest, Romania, where it was originally scheduled to take place in March 2020. The other two options are early March 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with the fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA 5), in Nairobi, Kenya, or early July 2021, in a back-to-back schedule with ICCM5 itself, in Bonn, Germany. ICCM5 has been rescheduled to take place from 5-9 July 2021, in Bonn, Germany.

Sierra reported that small virtual working groups, open online briefings, and submissions of written comments could also contribute to the finalization of outcomes for SAICM Beyond 2020, for adoption at ICCM5. She also called attention to the work of the High-Level Ambition Alliance for chemicals and waste, which seeks to raise awareness and ensure commitment for action on chemicals and waste management.

WHO has estimated that sound chemicals management could prevent at least 1.6 million deaths per year.

Representatives from Geneva-based UN agencies discussed the linkages between chemicals management and the issues that their organizations focus on. Manal Azzi, Senior Specialist on Occupational Safety and Health, International Labour Organization (ILO), stressed the importance of the ILO in the chemicals’ field, notably because of workers’ exposure to chemicals along the entire supply chain. Carolyn Vickers, Head, Chemical Safety and Health Unit, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized the WHO Chemicals Roadmap, and establishment of a global chemicals and health network, where national ministries network to facilitate the implementation of the roadmap. Vickers highlighted that at least 1.6 million deaths could be prevented annually by the sound management of chemicals and waste.

Discussing the role of civil society in the Beyond 2020 process, Giulia Carlini, Center for International Environmental Law, said the July 2021 ICCM5 and BRS COPs in Bonn, Germany, would disadvantage non-European participants. She said an online process, including virtual working group sessions and technical briefings, should ensure meaningful and effective participation going forward.

COVID-19 comes just as the public was beginning, slowly, to come to terms with the climate crisis and its far-reaching implications. The pandemic highlights how interconnected we are, and how impossible it is to disentangle the problems we all face in a globalized world. Holistic approaches to these problems are needed and they are needed fast. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), an umbrella term to describe a wide array of ecosystem-based actions that incorporate the natural environment to mitigate climate change and ensure ecosystem sustainability, has grown in prominence in recent years as potentially being such an approach.

Many companies are increasingly aware of the impact their unsustainable commodity production has on the environment and are recognizing that business cannot thrive in a world of environmental stress, poverty, and uncertainty. Some of those companies are starting to plan and implement preventive and restorative actions within their operations, with NbS providing a cost-effective tool to create a seemingly more responsible and sustainable forest-risk commodity value chain.

Detailed information on how companies are carrying out NbS within their operations, however, is still lagging. In a recent briefing, CDP analysed its 2019 Forests disclosure data on 543 companies that gathered information about the integration of NbS into their operations. We found that only 15% of companies reported having implemented any form of NbS, as well as a lack of consistency amongst those who did. The results spoke a clear message: we have a long way to go to encourage more widespread and ambitious implementation of NbS. As stated in the recent #TogetherWithNature statement, NbS must be considered a complementary approach to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, in addition to following a pathway of decarbonization, enacting comprehensive climate policies and enforcing proper accountability.

In the last year, NbS has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions on the environmental crisis. They featured heavily in the UN Climate Action Summit, particularly in the NbS Coalition co-led by China and New Zealand. At COP 25 in December, NbS were constituted a central theme in the high-level segments and the Santiago Call for Action on Forests. NbS are also set to take centre-stage in the negotiations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. For the private sector, it pays to be transparent, as businesses that disclose and take leading action on climate change can better identify and measure their environmental risks and opportunities. Data from STOXX has shown that CDP’s ‘A List’ has outperformed its global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a 7-year period.

The private sector presents a largely untapped opportunity for the implementation of NbS, when implemented in accordance with the best available science-based targets and with appropriate safeguards. As the COVID-19 crisis recedes, policymakers should seize the political momentum for the 2021 – 2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and recognize the role and participation of non-state actors in driving NbS, creating regulatory environments that are both institutionally and financially conducive for all stakeholders to take ambitious, measurable action. To start, they could:

1. Encourage corporate environmental disclosure

Disclosure is the bedrock of action. Corporate environmental disclosure needs to be more transparent and common, including for NbS. For this to occur, there needs to be improved regulatory frameworks to promote transparency in supply chains, fostering the integration of environmental protection assessments in business operations.

2. Mainstream NbS into legislation and regulatory frameworks for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development

Situating NbS as a cross-cutting policy tool within NDCs, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the SDGs (especially SDGs 12, 13 and 15) would not only help with the implementation of projects but would promote more accurate measurement of their effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

3. Improve the criteria, metrics and measurement of NbS

Whilst NbS are present in the majority of NDCs submitted to date, most of these do not include quantifiable targets. In order to harness private sector potential on the implementation of NbS and be part of a coherent global response to climate and biodiversity, there must be adequate and science-backed targets outlining the direction of action.

International policy efforts have multiple windows of opportunity to introduce integrated solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, and human development. All these issues are underpinned by our relationship with nature. Policymakers and corporate actors must engage in mutually supportive, ambitious, and carefully implemented action, to ensure that the potential of nature to be an important part of the solution to the current crises is unlocked.

The events allowed for an exchange of information while also demonstrating progress that is underway, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The June Momentum for Climate Change was conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The events took place during the time period that the annual meetings of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies would have convened as the Bonn Climate Change Conference, but they did not involve formal negotiations.

Over eight days from 1-10 June 2020, 17 open events and six additional events requiring registration, including meetings of the constituted bodies, took place. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary from the events indicates that several focused on the work of the constituted bodies, which are the bodies that focus on implementing various aspects of the Convention and the Paris Agreement on climate change. These technical bodies provided updates on their work and future plans. Formal meetings also took place, with the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement holding its first meeting and lead reviewers of biennial reports and national communications met to share experiences. Other events discussed ongoing and emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

During an opening session on the theme, ‘UN and the UNFCCC Vision for 2020 in the Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Opportunities for Sustainable Recovery,’ Selwin Hart, Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team, reported that the UN Secretary-General’s six climate-related actions to shape the recovery range from investing in green jobs and tying bailouts to the Paris Agreement’s goals, to ending fossil fuel subsidies, accounting for climate risks, and ensuring no one is left behind as we recover better, together. President-designate of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, Alok Sharma (UK), highlighted energy, transparency, nature-based solutions, adaptation, and finance as key COP 26 themes. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa emphasized that 2020 is still a critical year for countries to fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement, including by submitting enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by the end of the year.

During a closing segment, youth non-governmental organization (YOUNGO) representatives delivered messages highlighting the need for sustainable, low-emissions climate change conferences, calling for access to food, energy, education, jobs, and medicine for the most vulnerable, and supporting grassroots communities to decentralize decision making.

SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) noted that there had been more than 12,000 views of the 17 open events over the eight-day June Momentum event, and of the 136 panelists, 48% were female. With SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), she noted that several of the activities would advance the agenda, including on Action for Climate Empowerment and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture. They also noted events that emphasized the need for sustainable recovery, including by using NDCs as frameworks.

148,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-covid-19-impacts-on-investment-flows/,"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNCTAD Report Details COVID-19 Impacts on Investment Flows,"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released the World Investment Report 2020, which states that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a “steep drop” in investment flows and has hit developing countries the hardest. The report finds that lockdown measures have slowed existing investment prospects and caused multinational enterprises to reassess new projects.

The World Investment Report 2020 titled, ‘International Production Beyond the Pandemic,’ projects that global foreign direct investment (FDI) will decrease up to 40 percent in 2020, bringing FDI below USD 1 trillion for the first time since 2005. FDI is expected to decrease 5-10 percent in 2021 and to begin to recover in 2022, led by global value chains, replenishment of capital stock, recovery of the global economy, and restructuring for resilience. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said the outlook is “highly uncertain” and depends on “the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.” He stressed that the transformation underway in international production will “impact developing countries over the coming decade” and requires a “major policy rethink.”

The 2020 report highlights three technology trends of the industrial revolution that are expected to shape international production: additive manufacturing; enhanced supply chain digitalization; and robotics-enabled automation. The policy environment for trade and investment and sustainability concerns, such as differences between regions and countries on emission targets and environmental, social, and governance standards, will influence the pace and extent of technological adoption. The report states that there is an opportunity for increased sustainability if countries and regions take advantage of the new industrial revolution and overcome growing economic nationalism. The report describes four possible trajectories: reshoring; diversification; regionalization; and replication.

The outlook depends on the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.

The report features a chapter on investment in the SDGs, which finds that international private sector flows to four out of ten key SDG areas have “failed to increase substantially since the adoption of the goals” in 2015. Progress on investment in the SDGs is visible in infrastructure, climate change mitigation, food and agriculture, health, telecommunication, and ecosystems and biodiversity. Although sustainability-themed funds are growing rapidly in number, size, and variety, these finances are not yet translating into investments on the ground in developing countries. The report also finds that very few national strategies on sustainable development address the promotion of investment in the SDGs, and further warns that existing investment promotion instruments related to the SDGs are “limited in number and follow a piecemeal approach,” with countries most often promoting investment in the SDGs through incentive schemes. To ensure that increased interest in SDG finance translates into increased SDG investment, the report presents an ‘Action Plan for Investment in the SDGs.’

The Action Plan presents six transformative actions: mainstreaming the SDGs in national investment policy frameworks and in the international investment treaty regime; reorienting investment promotion and facilitation strategies towards SDG investment; establishing regional SDG investment compacts; fostering new forms of partnerships for SDG investment; deepening environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices’ integration in financial markets by establishing a global monitoring mechanism with a harmonized approach to disclosure; and changing the global business mindset. The Plan is a response to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution on ‘Promoting Investments for Sustainable Development’ (A/RES/74/199) that calls for concrete recommendations for advancing investment to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In Africa, investment flows are predicted to decline 25-45 percent in 2020, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and low commodity prices, especially for oil. The region’s manufacturing and service industries, including aviation, hospitality, leisure, and tourism have also been “hit hard,” a trend that is projected to persist into the future. The report identifies two factors that “offer hope” for the recovery of investment flows in Asia: major global economies are recognizing ties to the continent and promoting investment in infrastructure and industrial development; and trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is deepening regional integration.

In Asia, investment flows are predicted to decline 45 percent in 2020. The pandemic caused lockdown measures and factory stoppages that impacted factories’ production and supply chains in the region. In addition, decreasing corporate earnings and the economic slowdown have resulted in multinational enterprises postponing investment plans.

In Latin America, investment flows are expected to halve in 2020. The pandemic has compounded structural weaknesses and political and social unrest, exacerbating foreign investment challenges and triggering a “deep recession.” These shocks are expected to have the most impact in the commodities, tourism, and transport sectors. In addition, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, which depend on FDI in extractive industries, will be hurt by low oil and commodity prices. The Caribbean is expected to be “hit hard” by the collapse in tourism. The region is also predicted to be “strongly affected” by the global slowdown in demand, particularly in trade with China and the US.

Saturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

The update, posted to the EOHU website shortly after 2 p.m., showed three new cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, and one in Prescott-Russell. This brings the total number of confirmed cases within the EOHU region to 158 and represents the largest single-day jump in weeks.

Three of the cases are dated to Thursday, with one Wednesday and the last on Friday. The EOHU does not hold its briefings on weekends, so any further information about these five new cases, and any added to the count on Sunday, will await Monday afternoon’s briefing. Based on the episode dates alone, none of these new cases should be related to the region entering Stage 2 on Friday.

The EOHU also noted two additional resolved cases, both in Prescott-Russell. That leaves 21 unresolved cases in Prescott-Russell, four in SDG, and five in Cornwall. Another bright spot is that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Foyer St- Viateur in Limoges was declared over on Saturday— it dated back to a staff member testing positive. An outbreak was declared for a second time at the Pinecrest long-term care facility in Plantagenet on Wednesday, after an asymptomatic staff member tested positive. All residents and staff members at the facility will be tested again.","Three new COVID-19 cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, one in Prescott-RussellArticle contentSaturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). The purpose of the HLPF, scheduled for 7-16 July 2020, is to evaluate the global implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Organizations are concerned that measures are not in place to ensure their meaningful participation in the meeting, which will take place virtually due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“We as churches have invested significantly in the implementation of the SDGs and our experience on the ground could contribute to global level discussions such as those in the HLPF”, says Isaiah Toroitich, LWF Head of Global Advocacy.

Fear that voices will be “muted”

The LWF through the initiative “Waking the Giant”, builds on the potential of the 148 LWF member churches to contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. At the national level, Waking the Giant helps to establish and strengthen the link between faith-based actors, relevant government ministries and UN agencies. It facilitates joint planning and new partnerships to further strengthen the churches’ engagement.

Like the almost 500 signatories of the letter, LWF also fears that the perspective gathered in working with local communities will be lost if the virtual conference does not open up sufficient spaces for civil society actors, including churches. The organizations urge the UN member states to adjust formal procedures in order to ensure visibility and participation of civil society.

“About people and communities”

As countries evaluate the efforts made to address issues such as civil freedoms, gender equality and poverty, “It is vital that civil society actors actively participate to provide insights into the impacts of efforts made to general populations around the world,” the letter reads.

“The SDGs are about people and communities,” Toroitich adds. “Without the meaningful participation of civil society in the High-level Political Forum, the entire agenda loses meaning. No one should be left behind in the SDGs work”.","“Experience on the ground can contribute to global discussions”(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF).

Below is the Nigeria Country Report No. 2020/177, titled ""Nigeria: Technical Assistance Report-Additional Spending Toward Sustainable Development Goals"", issued in April 2020.

Preface

In response to a request from the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), a technical mission visited Abuja, Nigeria during January 29-February 11, 2020 to collaborate on an assessment of the spending associated with making substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mission comprised Mauricio Soto (head) and Mariano Moszoro (all FAD), and Julieth Pico (FAD expert).

This technical mission was financed by the European Union under the EU-IMF Public Financial Management Partnership Program (PFM-PP).

The mission was hosted by D.M. Dauda (Secretary of Programme, OSSAP-SDGs) and Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa (Senior Technical Advisor, OSSAP-SDGs).

The mission met with Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed (Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning), Prince Clem Ikanade Agba (Minister of State for Budget and National Planning), and Suleiman H, Adamu (Minister of Water Resources). The mission also met with Didi Walson-Jack (Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power), Emmanuel Meribole (Director, Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Health), Babangida Hussaini (Director of Special Projects, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing), and Adeoye E.O. (Acting Director, Department of Educational Planning, Research, and Development, Federal Ministry of Education).

The mission also met Katrine Mulvad Thomsen (Team Leader, Economic Cooperation and Energy, European Union Delegation), Amarakoon Bandara (Senior Economic Advisor, UNDP), Shubham Chaudhuri (Country Director, World Bank), Moses Ongom (Health System Adviser, WHO), Anthony Simpasa (Lead Economist, African Development Bank), and other staff of development partners.

The mission expresses its sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support given by officials and staff of these various organizations with whom the mission met. The team is especially grateful to Chukwuemeka Olanrewaju Ogbuehi (Ministry of Finance), Ogunleye Femi (OSSAPSDG), and Zainab Mangga (IMF Resident Representative Office) for the excellent coordination and support during the mission. The mission is also thankful to Laraba Bonet (IMF Resident Representative Office) for facilitating mission logistics.

Since the mission took place before COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the report does not reflect the impact from COVID-19 on economic activity in Nigeria. The report focuses on some of the medium-term challenges that Nigeria will face after the COVID-19 crisis, namely the additional spending needed to ensure substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Executive Summary

Making progress in the SDGs requires substantial additional resources. Concomitant with the reform priorities identified by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and other international development institutions, the mission estimates additional spending of 18 percentage points of GDP by 2030-a level higher than the average low-income and developing countries. Relative to other low-income and developing countries, additional spending is higher in education and water and sanitation, and lower in health, electricity, and roads (Figure).

Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. The authorities have made important progress in developing long-term plans in sectors such as health, electricity, and water and sanitation.

Education-increasing access and improving quality. The relatively low resources devoted to education are insufficient to deliver quality education for all. With 50 percent of the population in school-age, we estimate that total annual spending in education would need to increase by 7.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. A pragmatic approach should be taken depending on resource availability. For example, expanding enrollment could be done at a more modest cost of some 1 percentage points of GDP.

Health-tackling inefficiencies. Nigeria should deliver better outcomes at its current level of spending. Rebalancing the system, with an emphasis on primary care with public support, is critical. In the medium-term, additional annual spending of 4 percentage points of GDP would be needed to expand health workers, improve infrastructure, and improve health outcomes.

Electricity-rehabilitating and expanding power infrastructure. Annual investments of 1 percent of GDP are needed to expand electricity access and keep up with population growth. Rehabilitating the existing capacity can help meeting part of these investments. Mini-grids can play an important role in mobilizing capacity to remote and vulnerable communities.

Roads-expanding the road network. Increasing access roads from 26 to 75 percent of the rural population will cost 2 percent of annual GDP. It is critical to outline the road network and identify projects with high economic and social returns. The private sector can play an important role in this sector, supported by strong oversight to ensure value for money.

Water and sanitation-picking low-hanging fruit. A priority is improving access for the most vulnerable. Ending open defecation and expanding basic water and sanitation can be achieved at a modest annual cost of 0.6 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, providing safely managed water and sanitation for all will cost an additional 2.5 percent of annual GDP.





Beyond resources, improving coordination and strengthening governance is critical to delivering on the SDGs. The federal administration through its Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) is committed to advance towards the 2030 goals. In line with policy options outlined by the World Bank and the United Nations, progress in these sectors requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by strong coordination between the federal, state, and local administrations.

While development partners and the private sector can help, the government should be in the driving seat of these efforts. To support decision-making based on evidence, one priority is to collect and analyze data to inform best practices and better target scarce resources.

Article content Gault attended and qualified as a sergeant signal instructor at the Royal Canadian Corp of Signals in Camp Borden. “He instructed and trained the SDG Highlanders signal platoon through the 1930s,” said Gault. “He was the RSM, which stands for regimental sergeant major, of the Cornwall Collegiate Institute, a cadet core in 1932 and later as a lieutenant, organized and instructed a school of cadets.” Gault Sr. was appointed to the 2nd Battalion of the Highlanders and then volunteered for active service and attended the officer’s training school, went on to instruct at two training centres before being posted to England in 1943. “In England, he attended two battle schools, and qualified at the anti-tank school in England,” said Gault. “He then instructed in anti-tank warfare. He went from the 2nd Battalion to the 1st Battalion, being the active force in Europe.” Gault was wounded just before the liberation of Boulogne. He became an active supporter of the 1st Battalion Association, helping organizing tours, arranging for memorial plaques, and planning reunions. The association recognized him as an honourary life member. “My father was wounded, hit by shrapnel by a German motor grenade, wounded in the right side of his head, forearm and leg,” said Gault. “He was evacuated to England.” He spent four months in the hospital, next four to five months on rehabilitation and training reinforcements – anti tank – and was then appointed chief instructor later on.

“Our regiment was part of the initial landing in Normandy and a gang served in Northwestern Europe, right through until the end of the Second World War,” said Bill Shearing, spokesperson for the SDG Highlanders regimental association, known as Glens Association.

About 3,000 active battalion Highlanders went overseas to fight in the war, leaving behind 300 of their comrades in the cemeteries. The reserve members in SDG, consisting of about 18 platoons, encouraged young people to get involved in the force to potentially serve in the army, air force or navy.

“They were one of the three infantry battalions of 9th Brigade and 3rd Canadian Infantry Division,” said Shearing. “The brigade was the reserve brigade. About 570 Glens landed on D Day. Only one member was killed that day. They were carried in 12 landing craft.”","Article contentIt’s a momentous occasion as the Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry Highlanders celebrate the 76th anniversary of the Juno Beach landings.

Article content Hospitals in the region are starting to increasing services as the number of active COVID-19 has dropped and remains low. This comes as the provincial government entered Stage 2 of its economic reopening within the Eastern Ontario Health Unit. Per the guidelines, the process will take weeks and months. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Hospitals in Cornwall/SDG to resume services Back to video “Our initial focus has been surgeries and endoscopies, which is really part of the surgical services,” said Cholly Boland, chief executive officer of Winchester District Memorial Hospital. “We’re beginning to ramp up those services. “We have both patients that have been waiting for several months, literally, and patients were presenting today. We are scheduling the patients with the most pressing needs, whether it’s a need that has progressed over the last few months or it’s a need that presents today.” Hospitals in the region are collaborating to meet the provincial requirements prior to increasing services. Provincial criteria include a lower-than-average number of patients in hospitals across the region, appropriate staffing levels, and a sufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) among other conditions, according to a news release. Boland spoke to WDMH, but the same steps and procedures are being taken at Cornwall Community Hospital and at Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria.

Hospital are also ramping up their outpatient services in clinics that are staffed by physicians. Visits where patients walked in to speak to a physician have continued virtually. They will however, continue in-person visits where the doctor needs to do an examination or procedure. “Within a couple of weeks, we hope to be up to about 50 to 60 per cent of the number of volumes we saw pre-COVID, but the hospitals are a different place right now and will be for the foreseeable future,” said Boland. “Everyone is wearing a mask, everyone has to distance themselves when they come in and take enhanced precautions.” There are only a number of procedures they can conduct in the operating room during the day as there are enhanced preparations between cases. “In all likelihood, we won’t get up to 100 per cent of what we were before pre-COVID,” said Boland. “If we are, it’ll take a good long while now. By the same token, we also have to be prepared if by some chance, in a couple of months, another wave comes by and we’ll have to actually ramp down.” The hospital is limiting the amount of people in the waiting room and in the operating room. Staff members have placed tape on the ground to ensure a safe distance is met.

Patients that enter the emergency room are served based on who needs immediate care first. “What we’re talking about are people who didn’t require emergency or urgent care in March, maybe by virtue of them having to wait, their conditions has become serious and those are the people we want to address,” said Boland. “We continue to do emergency surgeries and emergency services as we always have. It’s the next level of priority that we’re addressing now and we do have a bit of a backlog on that, not only a daily basis but looking at the last few months.” Hospitals are prepared for a second wave of COVID-19.

That will be dependent on the environment and situation, such as if the rate of infection is greater or if there’s a greater demand on services for COVID-19. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

The Municipality of South Dundas marked its first civic-address sign installation under the program on Wednesday morning, planted on farmland owned by Coun. Archie Mellan.

What is the Emily 911 Farm Entrance Program? A lifesaver, potentially.

It’s a movement taking root in counties and communities across the province, inspired by a tragic occurrence in 2014, when a young girl, Emily Trudeau, 7, was killed in a farm injury in Hastings County west of Belleville. First responders could not immediately find the scene of the incident, in rural area near Tweed.

Emily’s parents helped launch the Emily 911 Farm Entrance Program a couple of years ago, and civic address signs are up in different parts of the province and of SDG, including South Glengarry and North Dundas. These civic address signs are meant for rural parcels without buildings (these properties mostly all already have civic address signs at their laneways), such as cropland and woodlots.","HULBERT — It’s another sign that the Emily Project continues to grow in the region’s agricultural heartland.

165,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/research-maps-interactions-between-economic-activities-and-sdg-targets/,"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Research Maps Interactions between Economic Activities and SDG Targets,"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to promote economic development, social inclusion, and ecological sustainability. Although all countries agreed to work towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, no country is on track. Recent assessments paint a bleak outlook: inequality is widening, hunger is on the rise, biodiversity is eroding at an alarming rate, climate change threatens all SDGs, and a pandemic is rampaging the world.

To accelerate impacts, the United Nations declared the 2020-2030 period a “Decade of Action”. All stakeholders are called on to contribute to the SDGs, but the private sector in particular was identified as being able to make a difference between complacency and action. The economic activities they undertake can advance, but also be detrimental to, the SDGs.

Defining interactions between economic activities and SDG targets

In societies, companies undertake numerous, highly heterogeneous types of economic activities. These activities sustain livelihoods and produce goods and services that help people attain a better life, but they also create negative externalities. Different types of economic activities thereby impact different SDGs. From the start of the SDG effort, the importance of ‘interaction-’, ‘linkages- or ‘nexus’-’ effects have been deemed vital for progress. Many research and knowledge-exchange efforts have been initiated: the Nexus community, SDG Interaction Knowledge Platform, LinkedSDG platform and the SDG Synergies approach. Most of these initiatives – as well as the related studies – concentrate on macro-economic or sector specific analyses. There is insufficient focus as well as evidence on how individual economic activities – as a proxy for corporate strategies – interact with the SDGs. This lack of evidence complicates the efforts of companies, governments, and investors to create smart SDG strategies that steer towards net positive impacts.

We have undertaken research to fill this gap. This research systematically reviews 876 articles, published between 2005 and 2019 and covering 420 economic activities (defined by the ISIC Rev. 4 classification), to synthesize the literature on the interface between individual economic activities and sustainable development impacts.

Moving forward

The research results identify the positive and negative interactions between individual and detailed economic activities and the topics defined by the SDGs’ underlying targets, as reported in the literature. At an overarching level, the findings reveal that economic activities bring ample opportunities for advancing SDGs. Most are sources of economic productivity (SDG 8) and drive industrialization (SDG 9) while many create and/or distribute goods and services that help people meet their basic needs (SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11). However, negative impacts are widespread, most prominently afflicting ecosystems (SDGs 14 and 15), driving climate change (SDG 13) and harming human health (SDG 3).

Yet these interactions vary widely across individual economic activities. Agriculture activities, for instance, feed the world, thereby having clear potential to help achieve SDG 2 (zero hunger). However, they also account for some 70% of water withdrawals globally which raises concerns for SDG 6 (water and sanitation), and the use of fertilizers and pesticides threatens SDGs 14 and 15 (life on land and below water).

As another example, electricity generation promotes SDG 9 (industrialization). But if electricity is generated through non-renewable sources, SDG 13 (climate action) is at risk, while SDG 3 (health and well-being) may be harmed due to air pollution. Estimates suggest that in China 15 million and in India 11 million years of life lost can be avoided by eliminating power generation emissions.

These findings can inform the creation of improved SDG strategies. Scientists and policy makers increasingly recognize that progress on the SDGs can be accelerated through a “nexus approach”. Recognizing that progress on one SDG can promote, but also be detrimental to, progress on another SDG, a nexus approach aims to manage the interactions between SDGs in order to advance multiple SDGs simultaneously and reduce the risk of trade-offs.

For example, eradicating hunger (SDG 2) improves health and well-being (SDG 3) and can help people escape poverty (SDG 1). Targeting these SDGs together, instead of treating them as isolated silos, brings opportunities for bigger impacts

The economic activities undertaken by organizations present a key lever for operationalizing this SDG-nexus. Economic activities drive positive and negative impacts on the SDGs, which are themselves entwined. Hence, there is an imperative to adopt a nexus approach to economic activities’ impacts on sustainable development, in order to promote the co-benefits of economic activities on SDGs and mitigate their trade-offs. The nexus approach not only deserves attention as part of policy agendas, but increasingly as an integral part of corporate strategies, for instance in the management of well-designed partnership portfolios.

Today we are facing an implausible pandemic that has affected the lives of the entire population. The economy is slowing, if not stagnating; it is like an invisible hand suddenly pressing the pause button.

The pandemic has also put the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) global agenda in jeopardy. Even before COVID-19 struck, many had cast doubt over whether all the goals would be achieved in 2030 as targeted when the SDGs were launched during the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015.

Economics professor William Esterly from New York University quipped that SDGs could be abbreviated to ""senseless, dreamy, garbled"". In one of its reports, The Economist describes SDGs as ""sprawling and misconceived, […] unfeasibly expensive"" costing US$2 trillion to $3 trillion per year and are impossible to realize. In fact, many say the SDGs are utopian and ambitious.

A year before the pandemic, the lack of global commitment to SDGs was beginning to be felt, particularly in terms of advocacy and media communication. A World Bank study (2019) showed that 31 percent of its ""knowledge products"", which include recommendations for the SDG action plan, had never been downloaded and 87 percent had never been cited.

In a 2018 report titled ""How the Indonesian Media Deals With SDGs"", University of Indonesia (UI) lecturer Irwansyah claims that not all SDGs are understood by the local media and only a few are framed based on public policy concerns. He concludes that the Indonesian media is not well informed about SDGs and the goals are not considered an interesting news topic.

Today, the media is more interested in political issues, especially in the time of COVID-19. SDGs have disappeared from the news, overshadowed by coronavirus headlines.

Looking at the performance of Asia-Pacific countries over the last five years, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) reported that in line with the current trajectory, the region will not achieve any of the 17 SDGs by 2030. Progress exists but at a sluggish pace, with efforts to meet over a half of the goals stagnating or even moving to the opposite direction.

In Indonesia, not all provinces have regional action plans to meet SDGs, let alone include them in their middle and long-term development plan. At the national level, some targets have not even been determined.

Based on monitoring conducted by the SDGs Center of Padjadjaran University, progress had been made up 2018 in achieving SDG target indicators. The SDG target score increased in 28 out of 34 provinces that year.

The arrival of COVID-19 has surely slowed down the country’s bid to meet its SDG targets. Almost all goals will be directly or indirectly affected, given that each goal does not stand alone but is interconnected with another. The UN SDGs report 2020 stated that now due to COVID -19 crisis, efforts to achieve the coals are even more challenging.

COVID-19 is impacting health, the economy, education, poverty alleviation, gender equality, the environment, climate change and other issues to be addressed under the SDG agenda. A quick simulation by Andi Sumner et al. (2020) in 138 developing countries and 26 developed countries shows that even in a moderate scenario, COVID-19 has added a poor population of 85 million people. While SMERU Research Institute found about 8.5 million Indonesians would plunge into poverty due to the pandemic.

The delay in achieving SDGs is unavoidable as states have reallocated their budgets to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. A study by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNDESA) shows there has been a change in the quality of the environment amid COVID-19, but it may not last long as large-scale recovery measures post-pandemic may warm the planet again.

The role of nonstate actors such as the private sector is difficult to predict, given that the pandemic has severely affected businesses.

The pandemic, however, is not an excuse to stop efforts to achieve SDG targets by 2030. COVID-19 is instead offering opportunities for us to do more to fulfill the goals. For one, the health crisis has taught us how to live a healthy life, to care for and share with others — the renewed mindset we need the most to achieve SDG targets.

The pandemic has also proven that everybody is equal. COVID-19 affects the young and old, poor and rich, men and women; the pandemic has put us all on the same boat.

Other blessings in disguise of this pandemic are the rise of global cooperation and strengthening of science-based decision-making, both of which provide an ideal opportunity for states to achieve their SDG targets.

The question is: How can we maintain this momentum? First, it is important for all actors to improve the communication strategy of SDGs and step up their campaigns. Second, there is a need to reset national and regional SDG targets for all indicators. Third, identify the right policies and suggestions needed to achieve the SDGs. This will require the government to determine the level of urgency, with priority given to the low-hanging fruit. Fourth, renew political will and commitment.

Fifth, develop knowledge, capacity and innovation to implement SDGs. Sixth, seek more funding sources for SDGs through partnerships, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility and synchronization of a national SDGs financing hub and the SDG Indonesia One platform.

Nonetheless, growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent inequalities remain and have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

On the issues of poverty, healthcare, and education, the 2020 edition of this annual report documents:

the first rise in global poverty since 1998, with an estimated 71 million people expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020;

the disruptions to health and vaccination services and limited access to diet and nutrition services could cause hundreds of thousands of additional under-5 deaths and tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths in 2020; and

school closures have kept 90% of students worldwide out of school.

This report was launched at the opening of the 2020 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2020), on 7 July. The report uses data as of June 2020 for selected indicators in the global indicator framework for the SDGs, as developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 July 2017.

The VLR Series seeks to provide guidance, definitions, and technical support for local and regional governments to engage in the VLR process. During the VLR process, local governments confirm their commitment to the SDGs and voluntarily assess progress toward specific targets.

During the launch event, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, UN-Habitat Executive Director, emphasized the need to empower cities and local governments through spatially-disaggregated data and sufficient resources. She called for integrating VLRs into the VNR process. Representatives from a number of communities that have developed VLRs discussed their experiences. The communities include: New York City, Madrid, Moscow, Oaxaca, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Barcelona.

UN-Habitat announced that, in collaboration with the Madrid City Council, UN-Habitat will organize an Expert Group Meeting on strengthening the VLR process by the end of 2020.

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

Many of the messages about data during the HLPF were not new; the importance of good data in tracking SDG implementation has been consistently underlined at every session. Nonetheless, the availability and uses of data change each year. Due to time lags in datasets, many of the data reports published during the first years after 2015 provided baseline assessments that let us know where we were starting rather than where we were going. Some of the reports launched in 2020 now focus on data collected since 2015. In March 2020, the UN Statistical Commission adopted 36 changes to the SDG indicators, which will affect indicator datasets in future years.

A consistent call during the last five years has been the need to strengthen statistical capacity to address data gaps through investment in data and statistics. This policy brief offers an overview of some of the data platforms and indicator sources that are currently available, to assist our readers in tracking SDG implementation as well as to stimulate thinking about where SDG indicator investments are needed.

Global SDG Assessments and Datasets

A starting point for thinking about SDG global datasets is to look at the key reports that are released prior to the annual HLPF session:

The SDG Progress Report and the Sustainable Development Goals Report rely on data from the UN Statistics Division’s Open SDG Data Hub. The data in this set are maintained by the custodian agencies for each of the indicators. In 2020, a SDG Progress Chart was also developed using this dataset to provide graphs for selected SDG targets showing how well each region is doing.

SDSN’s annual Sustainable Development Report incorporates a variety of datasets into its rankings of countries according to how well they are implementing the SDGs. In 2020, SDSN released an additional resource: ‘SDGs Today: The Global Hub for Real-Time SDG Data‘. This portal, which was developed in partnership with Esri and the National Geographic Society, provides access to datasets that are updated regularly and have been produced within the last year. The datasets are selected “based on the level of frequency, quality, international comparability, public availability, and ease of understanding.”

Several other platforms permit the user to explore SDG-related data through visualizations and other features:

IISD’s Global SDG Indicator Platform incorporates data from the Open SDG Data Hub into a user-friendly tool that permits the exploration of data through global maps. The Platform’s “dashboard” feature permits users to compare the data for two nations.

The SDG Tracker presents data from the Our World in Data database, which uses official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. The SDG Tracker offers charts and maps to view the status of progress on the SDG targets.

Resource Watch provides access to hundreds of datasets on the state of the planet’s resources and citizens. It provides dashboards for datasets on the ocean, energy, forests, cities, climate, water, food and society.

Country and Issue Specific Datasets

The Resource Watch “about” page highlights that, while “more data are available today than ever before,” policymakers, business leaders, and analysts often cannot access the data they need to make informed decisions about the environment and human well-being. The global platforms and datasets seek to increase transparency and access to data globally. The data ecosystem is enhanced with issue and region or country specific data platforms, which can sort through the large amounts of data and bring context and targeted functions specific to an audiences’ data needs. Such data platforms include the following:

The UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) data dashboard to help its member countries monitor their progress on the 2030 Agenda. The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators;

The Goal Tracker for South Africa, which provides information about South Africa’s national policies related to achieving the SDGs and seeks to offer tools for decision-making, resource allocation and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders in support of the SDGs;

The World Bank’s Sovereign ESG Data Portal, an online platform that provides sovereign-level environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, to support efforts by the financial sector to improve the sustainability of their investments by better aligning ESG analysis with key sustainable development policy indicators; and

The SDG 6 Data Portal, which provides snapshots of global, regional, and national performance on SDG 6 indicators, as well as data visualizations and animations showing changes that have occurred over time.

Community indicator systems, which organize data based on community-identified priorities, are supporting local-level SDG implementation (see for example this story about IISD’s headquarters city of Winnipeg, Canada).

2020 Target

Many studies of indicators provide as much information about where investments in data would be usefully applied as they do about where we are going on SDG implementation. The sustainable development community is acting on this information: the landscape of data platforms looks different now than it did for a policy update on data platforms published in March 2018. We will watch as it continues to evolve, especially in the coming months.

Data collection is the subject of one of the “2020 targets” (17.18: By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts). The reason this target has an accelerated completion date is also a reason for the interest in data: SDG implementation will be measured and driven through monitoring, based on the indicators. Watch this space for news about these critical tools for driving the 2030 Agenda forward.","This policy brief offers an overview of some of the data platforms and indicator sources that are currently available, to assist our readers in tracking SDG implementation as well as to stimulate thinking about where SDG indicator investments are needed.

The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.

The SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), also published its third series of policy briefs on SDG 7 and its interlinkages with other SDGs in support of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

‘Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report,’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), monitors and assesses the world’s progress towards global targets for universal access to sustainable, affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It also identifies best practices, policies, measures, and scenarios to accelerate further progress and simultaneously pursue other SDGs.

On universal access (SDG target 7.1: “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services,” including access to electricity (indicator 7.1.1) and access to clean cooking solutions (indicator 7.1.2)), the report finds that over 1 billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, increasing the connected proportion of the population from 83% to 90%. However, 789 million people still do not have access to electricity, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 70% of this deficit. The report estimates that by 2030, 620 million people will lack electricity access, 85% of them in Africa. The report recommends that governments respond to the COVD-19 crisis by working with donors and investors to ensure that off-grid developers, utilities, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain active and that governments adopt a suite of safeguards to protect energy consumers.

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report. While the global proportion of the population with access increased by 200 million between 2010 and 2018, 2.7 billion people remained without access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of those without access increased from 750 million to 890 million. The report concludes that 2.3 billion people, 30% of the world’s population, will continue to lack clean cooking fuels by 2030. It recommends that governments utilize more comprehensive household surveys to support more effective evidence-based policy and investment decisions.

On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption. This increase was driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy in the power sector. The report finds that while adoption of renewable energy in the heating and transport sector lags behind its potential, it will be required to achieve SDG 7.2 by 2030.

On energy efficiency (SDG target 7.3: “By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”), the report states that in recent years, the rates of improvement in global primary energy intensity have fallen to 1.7%, although the average rate of improvement between 2010-2017 was 2.2%. To achieve the SDG 7.3 energy efficiency target of doubling the historic improvement rate, annual improvement will need to increase to an average of 3% per year between 2017-2030. The report recommends that countries make energy efficiency a policy and investment priority through minimum energy efficiency standards, market-based mechanisms, financial incentives, and other means.

On international public finance (SDG target 7.a: “By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology,” with indicator 7.a.1 focusing on international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy), the report finds that while total international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy doubled to USD 21.4 billion in 2017 over 2010 flows, only 12% reached least developed countries (LDCs), which are the furthest from achieving SDG 7 targets.

To support this year’s HLPF, the SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group policy briefs highlight the interlinkages between energy and the other five thematic sessions of HLPF 2020 (Advancing human well-being; Ending hunger and achieving food security for all; Protecting the planet and building resilience; Sharing economic benefits; and Bolstering local action to accelerate implementation). Additionally, the policy briefs emphasize the significance of the SDG 7 targets in light of the COVID-19 crisis, propose solutions to continuing momentum towards the targets during the pandemic, analyze opportunities to support SDG 7 implementation through the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and review regional perspectives for advancing SDG 7. [Publication: Policy Briefs in Support of the High-level Political Forum 2020: Accelerating SDG 7 Achievement in the Time of COVID-19]","The custodian agencies of SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) issued their annual report tracking progress on the Goal.
The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.
Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report.
On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption.

The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

AstraZeneca, Deloitte and BP are among a cohort big-name businesses to have jointly unveiled £500,000 of grant funding for young innovators working on projects driving progress towards the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Coordinated through the One Young World platform, the funding will be complemented with mentorship sessions between the businesses and the entrepreneurs. It is hoped that, for every £1 invested through the scheme, £15 of social value will be delivered.

In order to receive funding, each project had to prove how it is driving progress towards one of the Global Goals, across the entire scope of its aims and targets. The initiative was open globally and has named winners from Asia, Africa, Canada, Central America and Latin America, as below:

The SDG 2: Zero Hunger prize was awarded to Canada-based Tailored, a startup producing plant-based, culturally relevant food products at price points accessible to families facing poverty. Reckitt Benckiser, the parent firm of brands including Air Wick, Nurofen and Lysoll, is supporting this category.

The SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing prize went to Colombia-based BIVE. BIVE’s BR13 initiative provides best-practice advice and leadership tools centred on issues such as non-communicable diseases, mental health and sexual health in a digital format. It is specifically tailored for young people living in rural areas without rapid access to quality, affordable healthcare. AstraZeneca is supporting this category and will also allocate funding to Create Purpose, a Mexican organisation promoting non-communicable disease prevention for orphans and other vulnerable children.

The SDG 4: Quality Education category winner is CAYSTI, a Cameroonian initiative boosting access to STEM and arts education in rural locations using tech-based solutions. Deloitte is the category sponsor.

The SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation prize was awarded to Ekogroup H2O+. This Colombian project is driving behaviour change around rainwater harvesting in the country’s urban areas and will receive support from Reckitt Benckiser.

The SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy funding has been awarded to Climatenza, an initiative accelerating the deployment of solar thermal technology across India’s business sphere. This category is sponsored by BP, which recently invested $200m in solar developer Lightsource.

The SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure category winner is Nepal-based fintech social enterprise Aeloi. Aeoli specialises in tracing climate impact finance and will receive support from Standard Chartered Bank.

The SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities prize went to Blend Edu, a startup working to promote diversity and inclusivity in Brazilian businesses through educational experience. The category sponsor here is Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).

The SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production winner, backed by Mondi Group,is Canadian biotech firm Genecis. Genecis takes low-value organic waste streams and turns them into materials which can be used to replace single-use plastics.

The SDG 13: Climate Action category was specifically open to entrants from the sustainable agriculture space, given that agriculture is a key driver of both emission and nature loss. The winner is Xillinat, a Mexican natural substitute for sugar and sweeteners which requires less land, water and pesticides to produce and is suitable for diabetics. Asahi will support Xillinat.

The SDG 14: Life Below Water funding is being provided by Credit Suisse to repurpose, an Indian social enterprise helping businesses achieve plastic neutrality. Credit Suisse is notably The World Bank’s partner on its sustainable water bond, and, in 2019, aligned its strategy with the SDGs.

Decade of deliverance

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”. Previous backers of the initiative, which is called Lead2030 and has been running since 2018, include KPMG and Porter Novelli.

The announcement of this year’s prize winners comes shortly after UN Global Compact published the results of a survey conducted among representatives from the sustainability teams or C-suite of 615 businesses. Of the respondents, less than one-third said their sector is moving rapidly enough to deliver adequate progress against the SDGs which it should be framing as a priority and just 39% believe that the SDG-related targets set by their own business are ambitious enough.

UNGC argued that while many businesses may feel that social and economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis will hamper their sustainable development progress, they must ultimately seize the moment to increase their ambition, given that the pandemic has highlighted social and environmental issues and could ultimately exacerbate them.

The report argues that 15 systemic transitions across three socioeconomic systems could create annual business opportunities worth USD 10 trillion and 395 million jobs by 2030.

The report titled, ‘The Future of Nature and Business,’ states that there is “no future for business as usual.” It finds that while fighting climate change is essential, it is “not enough,” and “a fundamental transformation” is needed across the socioeconomic systems of: food, land, and ocean use; infrastructure and the built environment; and extractives and energy. These systems, the report notes, represent over a third of the global economy and provide up to two-thirds of all jobs. They also drive the threats which endanger almost 80% of the total threatened and near-threatened species.

Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is a “stark reminder” that ignoring biophysical risks can have “catastrophic health and economic impacts at the global scale,” the report calls for recovery efforts to address the planetary crises of climate change and nature loss in a way that would “build back better” and avoid “an unsustainable and dangerous business-as-usual approach.”

The report identifies 15 systemic transitions that can “pave the way towards a people- and nature-positive development that will be resilient to future shocks.” It notes, however, that USD 2.7 trillion per year through to 2030 will be needed to scale the transitions, including deployment of the technological innovation critical to 80% of the business opportunity value identified in the report.

The publication, prepared in collaboration with AlphaBeta, is the second of three reports in the WEF’s New Nature Economy series. Its findings inform the working priorities of the Champions for Nature, a community of leaders working towards a nature-positive global economy, and feed into a Policy Companion report which helps governments ensure that nature is integrated into economies to deliver “high-quality jobs and new sources of economic value, while preserving the natural capital needed for public health and societal resilience.”

The New Nature Economy series aims to contribute to the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) by making the case for why the nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy, identifying a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation, and scoping the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges.

179,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/mangroves-a-unique-ally-in-the-climate-emergency/,"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Mangroves: A Unique Ally in the Climate Emergency,"Nearly 20 years have passed since the first time I stepped into a mangrove forest, yet the memory is still among my fondest memories. I was already captivated by mangrove ecology through my studies; but it was only when my boots first disappeared under the mud that I was truly hooked. I arrived at Ko Phra Thong in Thailand to take part in a survey of the mangroves on the island and I was so keen to get started that I didn’t even stop to change from shorts to long trousers, or to slap on some mosquito repellent. Well, they had a feast on my legs, leaving some very physical, itchy reminders of the experience, to add to the romantic charm of the soft green dappled light and salty breeze.

Mangrove forests are unique ecosystems, straddling the boundary between ocean and land. Their significant roles in securing a habitat for a wide range of unique species of fish, insects, mollusks and plants, and in providing direct and indirect livelihood benefits for coastal communities are all well studied. The COVID-19 outbreak and the related impacts on countries and communities put increasing visibility and recognition of the importance of the availability and sustainability of such food security and livelihoods benefits.

More recently, attention has turned to the importance of mangroves as sinks of greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide and methane – and hence their critical role in mitigating climate change. Moreover, intact and healthy mangroves act as a natural buffer, contributing to the reduction of impact forces and depth and velocity of natural hazards, thus contributing to coastal communities’ ability to adapt as the frequency and severity of such events increases as a result of climate change.

The prominence of mangroves in international dialogues and national efforts on ‘nature-based solutions’ is therefore becoming more evident, as we set out to harness the unique qualities of mangroves towards both the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.

Foremost among these efforts is the inclusion of mangroves in national REDD+ strategies, through which developing countries aim to incorporate the forest sector into their policies and approaches to tackling climate change, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Preparation of national REDD+ strategies involves the identification of specific policies and actions to address, and where possible to reverse, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and to increase forest cover. In so doing, several countries, including Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Myanmar, recognized the value of mangroves-based mitigation actions. Furthermore, at least 45 countries around the world specifically mentioned mangroves in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards fulfilling the global goals of the Paris Agreement.

When countries introduce practical, cost-effective and achievable policies and actions for the management and protection of forests, while providing sustainable development opportunities for local forest communities, the rate of forest loss can be reduced, as well as the net emissions of greenhouse gases from forest areas.

Countries that achieve emission reductions from deforestation and fulfill UNFCCC REDD+ Warsaw framework are eligible for results-based payments, for example through the Green Climate Fund RBP pilot programme, bilateral agreements with donors, or other mechanisms. In this regard, reduction of mangroves deforestation, as a high carbon-rich ecosystem, can be a strategic ally to achieve results of magnitude.

FAO, also through and with the flagship UN-REDD Programme (a collaborative effort between FAO, UNDP and UNEP), is working with countries to integrate mangroves into their REDD+ strategies and implement specific actions. Entry points include changes to practices in communities involved in shrimp farming or charcoal production, and support to governments in defining comprehensive packages of policies and measures for mangrove ecosystems and the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods. While planning their REDD+ activities, countries may want to carry out assessments and develop studies on the impacts and benefits of mangroves on the wider landscape and rural economy, so that the results could be presented to relevant line ministries, development partners and initiatives. They may also request support in developing specific emission factors and allometric equations for mangroves, and share these with other countries. This will allow for much more accurate estimations of the potential and actual contribution of mangrove-based actions, policies and measures to REDD+ strategy objectives.

Despite all the recognition mentioned so far, mangroves continue to be subject to pressures such as expansion of commercial agriculture and aquaculture. Their depletion is a cause of serious environmental and economic concern to many developing countries.

During the week of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, it is key to remember the importance of protecting, sustainably managing and restoring this key ecosystem, and the opportunities this represent for countries and local communities, as a key ally for food security, sustainable livelihood, and in the fight against climate change.

Keeping the world’s mangroves healthy will require a combination of integrated coastal management, inter-sectoral coordinated rural development policy, and the sharing of technical expertise and effective practices within and between countries. These efforts will be in vain unless they are combined with approaches to improve the livelihoods and capacities of the people whose actions most directly affect mangroves, such as rural farming and fishing communities.

The inclusion of mangroves management, conservation and restoration in REDD+ strategies and in NDCs represent opportunities to boost moving towards healthy and sustainable ecosystems. In addition, the upcoming UN Decade on ecosystem restoration represents another important vector for actions on the ground. Countries demonstrated interest in mangrove restoration, with approximate thirty countries mentioning mangroves in their restoration pledges as part of the Bonn Challenge.

Addressing climate change is a crucial part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, yet countries have made little progress on this goal. In the years ahead, countries have to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can join us in taking action on this issue here

Dozens of developing nations across the globe have achieved the targets for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action — reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate resilience — while developed countries remain far behind, according to a recent report by the UN.

The Sustainable Development Report 2020 notes that 43 countries in Africa have achieved the targets for SDG 13, alongside more than a dozen other countries throughout Asia and Latin America. Moldova is the only country in Europe to have achieved SDG 13.

A color-coded map in the report shows where countries stand in terms of general progress on the goal based on several academic papers from the past few years, including from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Countries that have achieved the five targets of SDG 13 are in green, while those farthest behind are in red.

This map shows progress made towards SDG 13. Countries in green have achieved the SDG. Yellow indicates that challenges remain; orange that significant challenges remain; red that major challenges remain; grey that information is unavailable.

Of the top 10 greenhouse gas emitters in the world, which account for nearly 70% of global emissions, only India is in green. China, the largest emitter in the world, has improved on climate action in recent years, but faces challenges that currently make achieving the goal by 2030 unlikely, including an overreliance on coal, a relentless construction industry, and growing energy demands.

The US, the second largest emitter, has regressed on goal 13 in recent years and is nowhere near achieving the targets. In recent years, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, scrapped plans to improve the gas mileage of cars, unraveled a plan to increase the efficiency of power plants, and has made it easier for companies to drill for fossil fuels.

Countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Vietnam, and Pakistan have all reached the targets of goal 13. In the case of Ethiopia, the government is working to reduce agricultural emissions, promote forest growth, invest in renewable energy, and implement energy efficiency throughout industries.

What this means in terms of achieving the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, isn’t discussed at length in the report. The SDGs do not include concrete emissions reductions or temperature increase targets.

As a result, critics have argued that the SDGs fail to meaningfully address climate change and that even if they’re achieved, the global environment will continue to deteriorate and emissions will remain at catastrophic levels.

The Climate Action Tracker, which assesses how the emissions reductions of countries relate to a warming climate, found that only Morocco has developed a plan compatible with the Paris climate agreement. Only two countries — India and Ethiopia — have plans compatible with staying under a 2 degrees Celsius rise.

Because leading polluters have failed to take climate change seriously, the world is far from achieving SDG 13 by 2030, and will likely blow past the Paris climate agreement goal of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unless dramatic interventions are made, then the world could pass the 1.5 degree Celsius mark in the next four years and temperatures could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which would usher in apocalyptic consequences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in global emissions, but analysts forecast that emissions will bounce back in the years ahead because emissions had been steadily rising in recent years, despite record levels of investment in renewable energy.

The fact that renewable energy is booming around the world, yet emissions continue to rise, shows how growth-oriented economies undermine climate action.

For emissions to decline at levels required by the Paris agreement, countries would have to overhaul their entire economies. In the aftermath of the pandemic, countries have the opportunity to embark on green economic recoveries that scale down carbon-intensive and environmentally harmful industries like fossil fuel production.

Projects such as the Great Green Wall in Africa — which seeks to regenerate landscapes across the Sahel and create community-based economic development — are a powerful model for the years ahead.

182,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/covid-19-what-happens-when-summer-heatwaves-strike/,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: COVID-19: What Happens When Summer Heatwaves Strike?,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak started in the middle of winter in the Northern hemisphere, it has become clear that it is to stay with us throughout and beyond the summer. The past few summers were among the hottest ever recorded, and forecasts have similar predictions for 2020: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has put out a warning that this summer will likely see temperature extremes once again. With heatwaves becoming more extreme and lasting longer, they increasingly affect human health.

For example, in Germany alone, the heatwave of 2003 resulted in nearly 7,000 deaths and many heat-related illnesses such as heat strokes, dehydration, and cardiovascular diseases. Many of these have to be treated in hospitals and will therefore put an additional strain on the capacities of the healthcare system.

Heatwaves are particularly problematic for urban citizens because densely built-up urban areas are especially prone to the so-called “heat island effect.” This effect occurs because when buildings are close together, they heat up one another. This is why urban areas are often up to 3°C warmer than their rural surroundings. Additionally, temperatures hardly drop overnight anymore due to a lack of ventilation and thermal absorption of houses and surfaces. This leads to “tropical” nights when temperatures do not drop below 20°C, adding to the residents’ health stress.

When heatwaves strike, people in cities tend to flock to green open spaces like parks or to bodies of water because these have a cooling effect. However, this behavior leads to exactly the kind of overcrowding which is not compatible with physical distancing. In the past, many European cities took innovative precaution measures to allow people to cool down. They extended the opening hours of public pools or air-conditioned public spaces like town halls or shopping centers, for example. However this year, we will be facing a complete closure of these facilities or at least restricted hours of operation.

If the predictions are true and this summer proves to be extraordinarily hot, more people than ever before will be working from heated-up homes (most European countries do not have air conditioning in private residences) instead of air-conditioned office buildings. Their options to take weekend trips to the countryside will also be more limited than usual. Even taking a longer summer vacation to flee hot cities for a couple of weeks will be more difficult to realize.

Yet, if urban citizens are left without options to cool down, it will put an additional burden on healthcare systems as people suffer from heat-related symptoms. The heat will also take a toll on their mental health when, in addition to contact bans and restrictions, they have to deal with the discomfort caused by heat that they can hardly escape.

It is crucial to develop concrete ideas for how the urban population can safely navigate the summer.

Those cities that have already invested in large-scale green or blue infrastructure such as green open spaces and ponds will have an advantage. Such multifunctional spaces are not only cooler during heatwaves, but they also protect from natural hazard impacts like heavy rainfalls or flooding, which makes them a worthwhile investment beyond the pandemic. If they are designed in a grid with pocket parks and community gardens, the risk of overcrowded green areas and temporary closures decreases. We need to work out how to best utilize these existing spaces so that a large number of people can cool down safely.

While it may not be possible to build a park in time for a heatwave, it is not too late to create multifunctional spaces with mobile shading elements and some vegetation in crowded neighborhoods. Parking areas or empty lots, for example, have great potential for quick and highly effective conversion. Schoolyards could also be opened up for the public. In addition, we need space for cyclists and pedestrians where they can safely move around with enough distance between them. Many cities are addressing these challenges. Brussels, for example, has just introduced a new traffic concept for its inner city, and Munich has introduced pop-up trails.

There are also measures that individuals can take, which can be encouraged. Green roofs and walls contribute to cooling homes, for example. Now is the time to think about greening houses or retrofitting them, for instance by adding sunshades or vegetation to provide shade. Another measure is to enhance thermal insulation and ventilation systems of residential buildings.

Which measures work best where has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. People’s living arrangements are different and so are their challenges, which calls for different solutions. Those of us who live in small apartments without balconies or gardens and whose apartments heat up quickly will be more challenged than those living in large homes with big outdoor spaces. These kinds of social dimensions have to be taken into account.

At the same time, we have to keep in mind that while this pandemic is hopefully a temporary challenge, another more long-term pressing challenge, climate change, must not be neglected in our efforts. While houses and apartments can be cooled down with air conditioning units, experts consider them a form of “maladaptation.” Firstly, air conditioning units use a large amount of energy, which is harmful to the environment, and secondly, they give off heat to the surrounding area, which then gets even hotter.

The long-term goal for livable cities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) must be green-blue infrastructure, which not only benefits climate change adaptation and mitigation (SDG 13) but also gives us space for leisure and recreation, and ultimately contributes to human health and well-being (SDG 3). At the same time, it can contribute to multiple goals of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) as well as targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), including “build back better” as the guiding principle in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (Priority Area 4).

Finally, there are also some promising societal developments that we have seen with COVID-19. Over the past weeks, numerous community initiatives to support the elderly and other vulnerable groups have been initiated in many cities, including activities that bring together previously often unknown neighbors. Younger neighbors go shopping for older neighbors so that they do not expose themselves to the increased risks of contracting COVID-19, for example. Also in other crises, some societal groups tend to be more vulnerable than others. Less vulnerable groups supporting more vulnerable ones is a mechanism that has been proven highly successful in times of crisis, including during heatwaves, making it possible to spare the elderly from having to go to the supermarket on particularly hot days.

It is certain that COVID-19 will profoundly change how we experience summer, but it is not too late to prepare so that we can still enjoy the warmer temperatures.

AfDB concludes $116m Nedbank SDG-linked bonds

Green bonds can help raise finance to meet climate targets

According to Mike Davis, the group executive for balance sheet management at Nedbank, this R2 billion (around $116 million) SDG bond underscores Nedbank’s commitment to driving sustainable development in Africa through the deployment of innovative funding mechanisms, to ensure that capital flows are orientated towards responsible investing.

“Our renewable energy bonds clearly demonstrated Nedbank’s commitment to facilitating asset finance with a focus on moving South Africa’s renewable energy agenda forward,” he explains, “but we have always recognised that maximising sustainable development funding requires capital or debt commitment as well; and this sustainable capital instrument, with its green use-of-proceeds commitment, is our way of meaningfully delivering on this responsibility.”

…maximising sustainable development funding requires capital or debt commitment as well…

Davis points out that the launch of this sustainable capital instrument, which was designed and created in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), allows Nedbank to give even greater effect to its stated purpose to use its financial expertise to do good.

“The use-of-proceeds commitment that underpins this capital instrument not only provides evidence that Nedbank is providing significant financial support to the Sustainable Development Goals, and particularly SDG 7,” he explains, “but also serves as a significant drawcard for foreign investment in South Africa, which is sorely needed at this point, if for no other reason than to help the country build fiscal and monetary resilience and to see it through the challenging economic times that lie ahead.”

The significance of this sustainable capital instrument is further emphasised by the fact that it comes a little over a month after Nedbank’s shareholders unanimously voted in support of two new sustainable development resolutions.

These commit the bank to adopting and publicly disclosing an energy policy and reporting fully on its approach to measuring, disclosing and assessing its exposure to climate-related risks.

Davis says that the launch of the sustainable capital instrument is a prime example of Nedbank putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to delivering on these resolutions.

Green bonds: Long-term impact

The instrument is effectively the bank’s commitment to funding the origination of impact-based assets that will not only promote immediate proactive sustainable development, but also ensure the long-term sustainability and positive impact of the bank’s balance sheet into the future.

“With the imminent launch of the JSE Sustainability Segment later in July, it is imperative that banks fully embrace the absolutely vital role they must play in enabling and driving sustainable socioeconomic development for the benefit of all,” Davis emphasises,”not only by facilitating third-party investment, but also through the appropriate application of capital into where it is needed most.”

This Bond has been validated independently by the Carbon Trust who provided a second party opinion and reaffirmed that this capital instrument aligns fully to the Green Bond Principles, thereby lending full credibility and transparency to the utilisation of the proceeds to support sustainable development initiatives and adding significant value to the instrument and its investors.

Stefan Nalletamby, the director for the financial sector department at the African Development Bank, congratulated Nedbank on its launch of South Africa’s first ‘green’ tier 2 capital instrument and expressed the hope that this would be the first of many such instruments, representing a groundswell of innovative capital commitment to sustainable development by the country’s financial institutions.

The use of proceeds aligns with AfDB’s “Light Up and Power Africa” High 5 priority which entails providing clean energy to the South African / SADC power pool.

Nalletamby said, “We are very pleased to be able to support the South African economy by injecting investment into the private sector through a responsible and trusted partner committed to responsible investing. This investment will help accelerate the recovery of the economy from the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”

“The successful launch of this instrument demonstrates the growing appetite in South Africa for sustainable and renewable investment on both sides of the balance sheet,” Davis points out, “and this will not only help to underpin and drive the development of South Africa’s green economy, but also send a very powerful message that it is time for both borrowers and investors to get fully behind the green agenda.”","An innovative SDG-linked instrument, listed on the Green Bonds segment of the JSE, has set a record as South Africa’s first ‘green’ tier 2 capital instrument launched by Nedbank.

Today, the UN’s Joint SDG Fund announces a historical $US60 million grant to close the SDG financing gap. The multi-year commitment, with an initial disbursement of $29 million being released this month, is considered the largest systemic UN led initiative on SDG financing in its history. With funding to be distributed across all continents, 40% will invest in Least Developed Countries and ten initiatives are to be implemented in Small Island Developing States.

“We have a historic opportunity to advocate for change, to curb inequalities and to invest in building resilience and sustainable development,” stated Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed at the recent SIDA Development Talks, Building back better – Finance and Development Leaders in Joint Action .

The Joint SDG Fund is committed to supporting a coherent and cohesive UN system. The investments in 62 Joint Programmes will offer pragmatic solutions, all assessed as relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: from addressing reduced fiscal space to align with the SDGs amidst COVID-19 recovery and financial planning to co-creating a new generation of risk-sensitive and responsive Integrated National Financing Frameworks. The results of the investment in SDG financing interventions will begin to materialize in the first quarter of 2021.

In March 2020, the Joint SDG Fund received 258 proposals to support SDG financing interventions in over 100 countries. The proposals were submitted to co-create a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) financing architecture at the national level and support countries by integrating the SDGs across national public financial systems and more effective public-private collaboration, ensuring that no one is left behind.

Mongolia’s Minister of Finance Khurelbaatar Chimed commented, ""The approval of the Joint Programme marks an important milestone in Mongolia's sustainable finance journey. The programme aims to catalyze more financial flows to deliver on the newly approved ambitious Vision-2050 by implementing several reforms that ensure better governance, coordination, and monitoring of integrated national SDG financing strategies. These strategies will also contribute to shaping a post-crisis future for Mongolia - one that is more resilient, inclusive, and ensuring gender equality. We highly appreciate the UN's timely support and partnership on this important initiative that will inspire local, regional and global stakeholders.""

The current health and economic crisis are a unique opportunity to make the world more inclusive and sustainable and this unique opportunity will not end here.

File photo: Pennelope Beckles

This country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

States presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations in a two week-long conference which included a high-level political forum on sustainable development and a three-day ministerial meeting held under the UN Economic and Social Council. The theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Beckles in her presentation of TTs first VNRs noted that it was centred around eight of the 17 SDGs and they were incorporated into TT’s national development strategy and vision 2030. The eight SDGs are good health care (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).

She explained that TT’s plan focused on putting people first by nurturing asset; delivering good governance and service excellence; improving productivity through quality infrastructure and transportation; building globally competitive businesses and placing the environment at the centre of social and economic development.

Beckles said, “Our commitment to “Leaving No-One Behind” has been anchored in the strengthening of the country's public policy framework through vision 2030 and the implementation of several policy initiatives directly related to SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5 and SDG 10.”

She noted that while TT and the world suffered tremendous losses due to covid19, this country minimised economic contraction through adjustments, reforms, and private sector support.

“Government has taken a multi-dimensional approach, with the introduction of a number of financial and economic measures to minimise contraction of the economy and maintain economic activity.

“This was in conjunction with the creation of a 'Road to Recovery' committee which comprised representatives from government, private sector, civil society, labour and academia, which was established to develop a plan for the reopening of society and the road to economic recovery for the post-pandemic period,” Beckles said.

She highlighted the progress within the health system through improved statistics in mortality rates with the Perinatal Information System which improves evidenced-based clinical decision-making for mothers and their new-born babies.

Beckles noted that, “The system contributed to the annual decline in the maternal mortality rate between 2015, from 42.9 per 100,000 live births to 12.3 per 100,000 live births, in 2018.

“Our nation's health sector also recorded a decline in the under-five mortality rates from 13.9 per 1,000 live births in 2016 to 11.3 per 1,000 live births in 2018.”

Beckles further noted TT’s moves to provide education for all with the increase of in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centers (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) through the increased participation of women in politics and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).

“The increase of the national minimum wage from $15 per hour, to $17.50 per hour, was in part aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable. These measures are further supported by a robust legal and policy framework which includes child protection and Gender -Based Violence units in our police service, she said.

Climate change, a big concern for small island developing states (SIDS) was of key importance to TT, Beckles pointed out and its contribution has been continued reduction in overall cumulative emissions from the electricity generation, industry, and transportation sectors.

Beckles added that TT continued to strive for strong institutions with the collaboration of government, law enforcement, academia, and civil societies among others for its effectiveness, but there remained challenges.

She said, “Undoubtedly, TT has made commendable strides. We are more cognisant of the challenges that could hinder our realisation of the 2030 Agenda. Climate change, citizen insecurity, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and the uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic can all undermine our development ambitions.”","Beckles present TT’s SDG goals progress to UNFile photo: Pennelope BecklesThis country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

Sophia Mirzayee, the United Nations Association of Canada community Liaison, says the program is implemented in Kemptville, Ottawa, Cornwall and Gatineau and allows youth to work with a mentor to address issues they are interested in. Mirzayee says ultimately all of the youth projects are tied to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. So these are 17 goals that were put out by the UN that countries are supposed to achieve by the year 2030.

“For example one of the goals that the United Nations has put out is quality education. Another goal is no hunger, another goal is climate change, climate action, sanitation, water, water rights.”

Other goals include gender equality, goals targeting good health and industry and infrastructure, according to Mirzayee.

When youth ambassadors are accepted to the program they will go through four different weekends of training and are matched with a mentor to help with the process and each youth group is given a $500 grant to implement their project.

Youth can be between the ages of 15 and 25 to signup for the volunteer projects and mentors can be between the ages of 18 and 35. Mirzayee says the mentor will commit to around eight to 10 hours per month from August 2020 to February 2021 and they will be matched with two to three youth to help them create tangible community projects. Mentors will get training and the position is volunteer.

It was also the first day of work for Helen Thomson, who since that time has amassed more than 40 years of municipal experience in a career that began as an administrative assistant in the planning department.

“I feel very fortunate to have had such a long career at the County and I truly enjoyed my work,” Thomson said. “I have worked with many great Wardens, Councils and staff. The County has seen me through many of life’s milestones – getting married, having children and now grandchildren.”

Thomson said her decision to retire came with “mixed emotions” as she weighed her love of work along with her love of family.

“I discovered through the COVID shut down, I really enjoy being at home,” she said. “My office visitors were one-, two- and three-year-olds and a farmer who stopped for lunch. I have realized it is time.”

Thomson said she is looking forward to more time with her husband Don on their Martintown-area dairy farm. She and Don have three children, Drew, Kurtis and Kelsey, as well as five grandchildren, Brooke, Tristan, Scotlyn, Adelyn and Ashton. County CAO Tim Simpson congratulated Thomson on her decision and added a successor will have large shoes to fill.

“I have worked with many staff members over my own 30-year career in municipal government, and I can truly say that there is no one I have enjoyed working alongside more than Helen,” said Simpson. “Her loyalty to the County, professionalism, and work ethic are second to none. She has been my ‘go to’ colleague for almost 10 years and her retirement marks the end of an era in SDG.”

Warden Frank Prevost likewise congratulated Thomson on a most-deserving retirement.

“If I have a question, I know that Helen has the answer,” said Prevost. “On behalf of County Councils both past and present, I wish Helen all the best in her retirement and I know she will enjoy her time as a grandmother in the years to come.”

The County will begin work on a succession plan soon, with an update for County Council coming later this year.

The government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Prime Minister James Marape’s speech to the UN High-level political forum was delivered by National Planning Minister Sam Basil. It showcased the achievements and challenges of PNG. The conference was conducted at the APEC Haus early this morning via the United Nation’s website.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals range from Good Health and Well Being to Eliminating Poverty, Hunger and Climate Action.

Being a member of the United Nations, PNG adopted “Agenda 2030’ in the 70th session of the General Assembly in 2015.

This means PNG has agreed to measure its performances on development against the global benchmarks using indicators of the 17 SDGs.

In the first five SDGs, where it focuses on Ending Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well Being, Quality Education and Gender Equality, Prime Minister Marape says the population living below the extreme poverty line as per the last national survey has improved from 53 percent of the total population in 1996 to 39 percent in 2010.

The Prime Minister has noted improvement in health statistics that shows an increase in life expectancy rates but made mention that more focus needs to be given to health issues like TB and Malaria.

The other 12 SDGs include decent work and economic growth to responsible consumption and production.

In these different goals, the Prime Minister noted that the local economy has grown from an average of 6 percent between 2010 and 2014, highlighting a peak in 2013 at 13 percent before declining in 2015 to a 9.5 percent.","Share the NewsThe government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

“This motorcycle ride by is to pay tribute to all the frontline workers and emergency responders,” said organizer Bruce Hyderman. “These people place themselves in harm’s way to keep us and our loved ones safe and healthy during this COVID-19 pandemic. We are reaching out to rural areas to say thank you for your hard work and dedication. We will get through these tough times!”

The group first met in Lancaster at 11 a.m. From there, it made its way to Green Valley, Alexandria, through Maxville, to Long Sault and finally Morrisburg, where all the motorcyclists met up once more. Through their passage, they made sure to ride in front of the many long-term care homes and retirement homes. The group also rode past hospitals and fire stations.","Article contentThis article has been edited to clarify what several individuals’ roles within the Honour Ride were.

The Gini coefficient for Bangladesh fluctuates around the trend line, but the overall trend is downward from 48.9 in 2000 to 31.5 in 2010 indicating declining income inequality. But a much clearer picture of income distribution emerges when one looks at the income distribution between the poorest 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent. The picture that emerges is: the income share of the poorest 10 per cent is 3.85 per cent compared to 26.92 per cent of the richest 10 per cent. In effect, the income share held by the highest 20 per cent is 41.48 per cent. An estimated 63 million people live under the poverty line in a country of 163 million people.

Bangladesh has also witnessed rapid urbanisation with more than a third of its population now living in urban areas. Although population growth rate has come down to 1.2 per cent per annum, the country remains one of the most densely populated in the world. This urbanisation has been spurred by structural changes in the rural economy resulting from the increased commercialisation of the agriculture sector and widespread rural poverty. But this rapid urbanisation has caused heightened urban poverty with extremely poor living conditions for these rural migrants and also urban congestion.

CLIMATE CHANGE, MIGRATION AND URBAN POVERTY: The genesis of migration lies in people's quest to live or subsist in a form better than their present status. Some migrate for sheer survival, that is, to escape from poverty; others, to improve their quality of life, while still others in search for fortune. Since each of these pursuits is made by people who come from different socio-economic strata and hence have a different purpose for moving, migration is quite a heterogeneous phenomenon. In contemporary low-income economies, however, the principal reason for people to move is the worsening productive-resource-to-human-power ratio, stemming mainly from rapid population growth and an external demand for local resources. This has compelled large sections of the populace to migrate to look for work as a part of their survival strategy. Depending upon the needs and circumstances, people move seasonally, for fixed periods, or permanently. In this sense, the transition economies of South-East Asia, some of which are among the poorer ones in the world, present a picture typical of other low-income countries.

SLUMISATION AND POOR URBAN SETTLEMENTS: The role of migration in urbanisation is obvious in all societies and at almost all times, since urbanisation and urban growth take place through a combination of three components, such as (a) natural increase of the native urban population, (b) area redefinition or reclassification or annexation, and (c) rural-urban (or other forms of internal) migration. In a condition of developing urbanisation, the role of migration is even more pronounced while in the state of advanced urbanisation, where urban growth is almost stagnant or even declining, internal migration plays a minor or almost no role. Rural to urban migration may again take many forms, such as (a) permanent migration, (b) temporary migration, (c) seasonal migration, (d) circular migration, and (c) commuting. The process ranges from short distance mobility (commuting) to long distance and long term movement or permanent migration. In the case of Bangladesh, the status of academic as well as planning studies on internal migration is not too bad, although, all dimensions of internal migration might not have received enough attention. Considerable literature exists on the subject of determinants or causes of rural to urban migration. A Bangladeshi scholar working at an American University has, in a recent paper, classified the models of migration into two groups (i) one which isolates migration as a domestic phenomenon and (ii) the other which places causes of migration within an international politico-economic framework. Migration is the combined effect of both push and pulls factors and it is often difficult to separate the role of the two. Within the Push-Pull model, push factors (at rural end) may be identified for Bangladesh as: 1) Population pressure, adverse person-land ratio, landlessness and poverty; 2) Frequent and severe natural disasters (particularly river bank erosion), and 3) Lack of economic opportunities.

The impact rural to urban migration is both diverse and deep, both at the urban destination end and at the rural origin. Most of the researches have been at the urban end. Urbanisation and urban growth occurring due to migration have both positive and negative consequences and impacts. Some of the positive consequences of urbanisation are the following: Economic benefits: higher productivity, better income etc; Demographic benefits: lowering of age at marriage, reduction of fertility rate; Socio-cultural benefits: modernisation; Political benefits: empowerment, democracy.

Urbanisation is not an unmixed blessing. Its negative consequences are of great concern. These assume critical role under situation of rapid and uncontrolled or unplanned urban expansion. The negative consequences can be grouped as the following: Environmental consequences-- encroachment on productive agricultural land and forests, extreme pressure on housing, growth of slums and the pressure on and urban services; Economic consequences-- income inequality and poverty, ill effects of globalisation; Social consequences-- increased violence and crime, social degradation; Cultural consequences-- entry of alien culture, loss of national cultural identity.

HIDDEN IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AMONG URBAN POOR: Climate change can directly affect health because high temperatures place an added stress on human physiology. Changes in temperatures and precipitation including extreme weather events and storms can cause deaths directly, or by altering the environment, result in an increased incidence of infectious diseases. Air pollution can be exacerbated by higher temperature and humidity. Finally, virtually all effects of global climate change ranging from sea-level rise to impacts on agriculture and human infrastructures are linked at least indirectly to human health.

The incidence and severity of many health problems increase with increasing temperature. As temperatures increase, the body expands added energy to keep cool. The most immediate consequence, if the body temperature rises above 410 C, is heat stroke. This disturbance to the temperature regulating mechanism may result in fever, hot and dry skin, rapid pulse and sometimes progress to delirium and coma. Also, temperature stress can exacerbate many existing health conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Mortality from such diseases, especially among children and the elderly, increases dramatically during periods of hot weather. Quantitative algorithms based on historical data that relate morbidity and mortality to weather conditions suggest that global warming will increase heart related mortality.

The combination of higher temperatures and potential increases in summer precipitation could create the conditions for greater intensity or spread of many infectious diseases. However, risk in the human health sector is low relative to climate change induced risks in other sectors (such as water resources) mainly because of the higher uncertainty about many of the health outcomes. Increased risk to human health from increased flooding and cyclones seems most likely. Changes in infectious disease are less certain. The causes of outbreaks of infectious disease are quite complex and often do not have a simple relationship with increasing temperature or change in precipitation. It is not clear if the magnitude of the change in health risks resulting from climate change will be significant compared to current risks. It is also not clear if increased health risk will be apparent in the next few decades. On the whole, climate change is expected to present increased risks to human health in Bangladesh, especially in the light of the poor state of the country's public health infrastructure.

In general, climate change impacts tend to be more on the poor than the rich. Inequality is not inevitable, it is a policy preference. Regarding sustainable urbanism, policymakers should improve urban efficiency in order to lower the cost of living by dealing with urban crowding and providing public goods, eliminate the causes that lead to squatter settlements, and not discourage internal migration, which fosters an efficient allocation of the population and has an equalising effect across places.

In McIntosh’s case, he is pursuing criminology at Carleton University in the fall. He would like to defend people in court who allege they’ve been wrongly accused. He’s attended, court sessions which also sparked his interest.

“My mom worked for lawyers, ever since I was a kid,” said McIntosh. “I’ve always been around it and it was something I’ve wanted to do ever since I was young.

“I chose Carleton because the program is best suited for what I want to do when I graduated.”

He looks forward to start studying for a career in law, with an aspiration to become an attorney. He also wants to enjoy living in Ottawa as he lived and worked on a family dairy farm his entire life. He notes living in a big city will be interesting as he lived in the country his entire life.

“More people is going to be the biggest thing,” said McIntosh. “More people and more noise in the city.”

He just graduated from Tagwi Secondary School near Avonmore and was part of the web leader and link crew in school. Link crew is for Grade 9s and web leader is for Grade 7s.

“I learned leadership and that it’s important to make everyone feel included and it makes the transition to high school a lot easier for a lot of kids,” said McIntosh. “When I came to school, I knew how scary it was and link crew and web leader helped me find friends in addition to that.”

McIntosh participated in various sports and teams during his high school years, also playing competitive lacrosse for the Cornwall Celtics. He played football, soccer, and ran cross-country, where he won the spirit award.

As Eastern Caribbean countries strive to build back better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress toward attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), support is being provided as part of a historic United Nations Joint SDG Fund US$60 million grant launched to close the SDG financing gap and foster more inclusive, sustainable and resilient countries across the world.

In response to a global call, United Nations Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in collaboration with the governments of Barbados, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, has been awarded a USD$1 million Joint SDG Fund Grant after successfully submitting a proposal for a joint programme entitled ‘Harnessing Blue Economy Finance for SIDS Recovery and Sustainable Development’. The initiative will support the efforts of the three participating Eastern Caribbean governments to develop financing strategies in the Blue Economy and create an enabling framework for SDG investment. The successful proposal was among 62 joint programmes selected from 258 submissions supporting interventions in over 100 countries.

The two-year USD$1,140,000 Joint Programme will be led by the United National Development Programme (UNDP), with participation from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It will also benefit from counterpart funding of USD$140,000 from the three participating UN agencies.





The joint UN SDG Fund is a critical facet of the ongoing global UN reform, which enables the UN Sub-regional team in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean to access funding for SDG acceleration support to countries, working under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, by leveraging the individual strengths of specialized funds, agencies and programmes, to ‘deliver results as one’ and ensure that no one is left behind.

In welcoming the new joint initiative, that exemplifies the UN’s approach to ‘deliver as one’, UN Resident Coordinator, Didier Trebucq noted: “This presents another opportunity for the UN development system working cohesively, to deepen its partnerships with Governments of the Eastern Caribbean and to foster blue economic growth through innovative financing mechanisms, while ensuring that the SDGs are at the forefront of national policy and no one is left behind.”

With the Blue Economy engaged as a driver for regional economic recovery and development, emphasis will be placed on creating an enabling environment for Blue Economy financing by identifying policy gaps, key opportunities and specific financing mechanisms for achieving resilient growth. This catalytic investment will address the current financial challenges of the beneficiary countries, including the additional financial burden arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and build on existing partnerships with the private sector and development financing institutions, as well as existing UN projects on Blue Economy and other SDG-related areas in-country.

Speaking on the significance of the initiative, UNDP Resident Representative Magdy Martinez-Soliman stated: “The COVID-19 crisis has affected the Caribbean’s ambitions to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It has drained away resources that were much needed to finance the SDGs. This Joint Programme will support Barbados, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in their efforts to develop financing strategies in the Blue Economy and SDG investments. The three countries are at the vanguard of the Blue Economy “wave” in the region.”

The UN investments in 62 Joint Programmes around the world will offer pragmatic solutions, all assessed as relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: from addressing reduced fiscal space to align with the SDGs amidst COVID-19 recovery and financial planning to co-creating a new generation of risk-sensitive and responsive Integrated National Financing Frameworks. The results of the investment in SDG financing interventions will begin to materialize in the first quarter of 2021, and a second component is expected to be launched by the Joint SDG Fund soon that would allow other countries to benefit.","As Eastern Caribbean countries strive to build back better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress toward attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), support is being provided as part of a historic United Nations Joint SDG Fund US$60 million grant launched to close the SDG financing gap and foster more inclusive, sustainable and resilient countries across the world.

Registration for the Alexandria camp will begin on July 6. The Cornwall camp is open to children aged six to 12, whereas the Alexandria camp is open to children four to 12. “This is significantly smaller than previous years and that stems from the requirements in following the guidelines from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Eastern Ontario Health Unit,” said Jacquie Richards, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG. “Regulations in place allow us to only have a certain amount of spots available this year.”

It just wasn’t sure what kind of summer camp it would turn out to be. “Everything changes so quickly with the COVID situation,” she said. “Regardless of what was happening, we we’re going to have camp, a certain version of camp, whether that was going to be physical camp, which is on premise or virtual camp.” More On This Topic Cornwall Boys and Girls Club take part in Giving Tuesday Cornwall Boys & Girls Club kids get Best Buy scholarships When the Boys and Girls Club received the go ahead to host the summer camp, its team took the time to reformat the camp’s procedures and formats in order to comply with the many safety and health measures. “We want to offer the camp in a fun and engaging way,” said Richards. “Our No. 1 priority is the safety and the well-being of the children, their families and our staff.” The club may be the first to open registration for a summer day camp in the region. The City of Cornwall doesn’t run day camp programs, and other area municipalities and agencies either already cancelled summer programs, or haven’t announced if they will open. The St. Lawrence River Institute is running a smaller version of its summer science camp, with information on registration and the program available on its website. This year’s activities will be promoting physical distancing, while maintaining fun. These include indoor and outdoor play, crafts, science experiments, water-related activities and more. There won’t be any field trips or out-trips that require transportation.

Staff members working in camps will be wearing masks however, when they are indoors and not capable of physically distancing. In addition, there will be daily health screenings when a child is dropped off to camp. This includes a check of the child’s temperature. Parents will also be asked to print and complete a screening questionnaire each day, prior to arriving at the camp, in order to speed up dropoff routines. “When we decided to offer a summer program, it really was respond to that need from families, specifically reaching out to us, seeking out summer child-care options,” said Richards. “Many families have reached out, needing to have a program in place for summer. Part of our role in the community is to respond to that need as best we can, as safely as we can.” In addition to the summer camp, the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG will launch next week its Virtual Summer Camp, for children aged six to 12. The free program is offered through a partnership with the Blue Jays and the Jays Care Foundation and will give youths the opportunity to connect with club staff and other children of their own age while playing games and building a strong social connection virtually. Registration and more information about the two camps is available by visiting the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG’s website, at www.bgccornwallsdg.com.

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

According to the community, since the inception of the settlement, they have never seen any infrastructural development by either the federal or state government.

Muhammad Adamu and Ardo of Riyom, who spoke on behalf of the community, said building the school was an indication that they were being carried along, adding that the community had never experienced such development.

He said, ""No words of thanks will equate what SDG has done to us. This is what we have been praying for in the last hundreds of years. I am 60 years old and I have never seen this kind of development in Mahanga until now. We appreciate the gesture and hope to have other social amenities like boreholes, hospitals, and electricity.

Adamu, while expressing happiness over the development, however, denied the rumour that the community's name was changed from Rankum to Mahanga, adding that the area where the school was built was not Rankum. He called on Berom communities to join hands together to move the place forward.

The youth leader of the area and secretary to the Ardo, Abdullahi Yusuf Ibrahim, thanked the SDG for showing much concern towards their plight and called on the state government to deploy teachers to handle the school effectively.

He said, ""One of our many wishes is to have primary and secondary schools for our children to be attending. We have been yearning for something like this but could not succeed.

The theme encompasses both the UN’s milestone year and the global crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

UN Member States agreed in June 2019 that the UN’s 75th anniversary will be commemorated under the theme, ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’ In a letter of 8 August 2020, Volkan Bozkir said that given the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global crisis, he suggests a more specific theme for the General Debate, as follows: ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.’

Bozkir adds that the debate should focus in particular on the most vulnerable, as well as on ensuring efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda “adapt to the crisis,” noting the outset of the Decade of Action for the SDGs.

The Assembly previously reached agreement on other details of the high-level week, in a decision adopted via silence procedure on 22 July 2020 (decision 74/562). By this text, the UNGA’s high-level meeting to commemorate UN’s 75th anniversary will convene on 21 September. It will formally adopt a declaration that has been negotiated by Member States in advance. Following negotiations, a silence procedure concluded without objection on 7 July, and UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande informed Member States that “consensus has been achieved and the text has been finalized.”

The decision indicates that the Summit on Biodiversity will take place on 30 September, the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) on 1 October, and the high-level meeting on the total elimination of nuclear weapons on 2 October. For all of these meetings, the decision authorizes pre-recorded video statements. The video statements “shall have an equal status as any statement made by any other representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall” and shall be included in the verbatim records of the Debate or meeting.

The decision also encourages Member States to hold all side events on virtual platforms to limit the number of people in the UN building.

Immediately prior to the high-level week, the UN will hold the first annual ‘SDG Moment’ on Friday, 18 September. Details are under discussion.","The president-elect of the 75th UN General Assembly has announced the theme for the general debate, which will open on 22 September 2020.

CBD Shifts SBSTTA and SBI to 2021

On 24 August 2020, the CBD Secretariat announced that it “is now clear that it will not be possible to convene any large physical intergovernmental meeting this year,” due to the global pandemic. Following consultations with the Bureaux of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD and its Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), as well as the Chair of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI), meetings of SBSTTA 24 and SBI 3 – the dates for which had been shifted several times – are being moved to the first quarter of 2021, “conditions allowing.” The Chairs, Bureaux, and Secretariat will consider options for virtual discussions in November.

In preparation for the SBSTTA and SBI meetings, the CBD Secretariat will convene virtual sessions in September 2020. The launch of the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook report (GBO-5) will also take place in September.

New dates for the third meeting of the Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework have not yet been announced.

The Secretariat also announced that the President of the CBD COP, Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment of Egypt, has requested an extraordinary meeting of the COP and the meetings of the Parties to the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols (COP-MOPs) at the end of 2020. The purpose of the ExCOP would be to consider and approve an interim budget for the Secretariat’s operations in 2021. The Parties are expected to consider the draft budget decision either through a silence/written procedure or a virtual meeting that would take place within the period from 16-19 November 2020.

CBD COP 15 was originally scheduled to take place in October 2020. Following an announcement on 15 July 2020, the meeting is now expected to take place from 17-30 May 2021, in Kunming, China.

UNFCCC Considering Additional Event in 2021

On 28 May 2020, the UNFCCC COP Bureau decided that the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), which was originally scheduled to take place from 9-19 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK, will take place from 1-12 November 2021, still in Glasgow.

Subsequently, at the end of June 2020, the COP Bureau decided to postpone the meetings of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB52) until 2021, at a date to be decided. During the time frame during which the SB52 meetings were originally scheduled, the Secretariat organized a series of virtual events under the banner, ‘June Momentum on Climate Change.’

In related news, during a UNFCCC COP Bureau meeting on 25 August 2020, the Bureau decided that “there could be an additional third session in 2021 if needed to catch up on work,” in order to be prepared for COP 26 in November 2021, according to a report from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group on Climate Change.

UNCCD Review of Implementation Set for February 2021

The 2020 HLPF was an important moment for the global policy community to take stock of where we stand on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Yet as we reach one-third of the way into our SDG journey, only 22 out of the 93 (23%) environment-related indicators showed good progress during the last 15 years. For the other 77% of environment-related SDGs indicators, there is either insufficient data to assess progress (68%) or it is unlikely that the target will be met without scaling up action (9%).

Freshwater shortfalls, rate of species extinction, deforestation, and land degradation are accelerating. With a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the international community is worryingly off track to meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Monitoring progress on the SDGs has never been more crucial, as both countries and the international community aim to achieve the Goals by 2030.

The importance of timely, quality, open, and disaggregated data has been brought to the fore by the COVID-19 crisis. Such data are critical in understanding, managing, and mitigating the social and economic effects of the pandemic. They are also essential for designing short-term responses and accelerated actions to put countries back on track to achieve the SDGs. In 2019, most countries reported that they were carrying out a national statistical plan (141 countries, up from 129 in 2018), but according to the UN, the pandemic has caused many National Statistical Offices (NSOs) in low-medium income countries to experience closures, funding cuts, and limitations in face-to-face data collection. These challenges may produce a lasting impact on countries’ abilities to produce timely and high-quality data.

Juxtaposed to this lack of environmental SDG data, sustainability reporting among the private sector has risen dramatically. According to the study run by the Governance and Accountability Institute, companies in the S&P 500 Index disclosing sustainability information rose from 20% to 85% between 2011 and 2017. Better informed investors, conscious of the growing economic importance of ESG indicators, have already been shown to be game changers in accelerating corporate action to tackle climate change. This information can be harnessed to help address the SDG environmental data gap.

It is vital that the private sector sustainability community works with the statistical community to understand each other and advance efforts to capture and analyze relevant data for the SDGs. To explore the role of private sector data in measuring progress towards the SDGs, CDP and GRI held a panel event during the HLPF 2020. Central to this discussion were the findings in the 2020 edition of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Report, which showed large data gaps remaining in the timeliness, geographic coverage, and level of disaggregation required. These gaps, together with the impact of COVID-19, highlight the need for data innovations and new partnerships required to bridge data gaps, including between the public and private sectors.

Two of CDP’s latest reports, on climate and nature-based solutions, demonstrate the need to ensure a conducive policy environment for globally standardized climate-related disclosure, mandating, where appropriate, the adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Finance Disclosure (TCFD), and to mainstreaming nature-based solutions into legislation and regulatory frameworks for policy coherence between climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development.

In this SDGs decade of action, the time is ripe to advance the Agenda that we started exploring back in 2012, on the margins of the Rio+20 conference, where the private sector was first recognized as a key actor on sustainable development through the practice of sustainability reporting (paragraph 47). Action does not mean reinventing the wheel. We can begin by looking at what data are already available from business SDG-related disclosure, understand how NSOs can access and use these data, and develop a methodology for the engagement and use of business-generated, SDGs-related data for the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

With the 2020 World Data Forum around the corner, efforts to leverage corporate environmental data to address the SDG data gap are increasingly gathering attention in a number of jurisdictions. A strengthened partnership between the public and private sectors will be essential to ensure COVID-19 recovery pathways are inclusive, sustainable, and in line with efforts to achieve the SDGs by 2030. While it will be important to think of new ways to address the effects of the pandemic, a framework response for sustainable development already exists: ensure the achievement of the Paris Agreement’s goals and the SDGs.

Transaction uses the bank’s SDG bond framework, which links its asset base to certain UN SDGs

20 Aug 2020 | Chito Santiago

ANZ on August 20 announced the issue of a A$1.25 billion (US$893 million) tier 2 capital bond linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the first bank issued SDG bond in Australia’s domestic bond market.

The transaction represents ANZ’s return to the green, social and sustainability (GSS) bond market in Australia, having issued its inaugural green bond in June 2015 amounting to A$600 million – which at the time was the largest climate-related bond by an Australian issuer.

The bond matures on February 26 2031, with the first optional redemption date of February 26 2026, and pays a floating rate of interest with a coupon of 185bp over three-month bank bill swap rate (BBSW).

“The transaction uses our SDG bond framework, which links our asset base to certain UN SDGs, giving our investors a unique opportunity to drive positive environmental, social and sustainability outcomes while earning an attractive rate of return,” says ANZ group treasurer Adrian Went. He says demand was strong following the maturity of its 2015 green bond earlier this year.

The latest bond is ANZ’s third issuance under its SDG bond framework, which has been in place since February 2018. The bank now has around A$4 billion-equivalent of SDG bonds on issue, having arranged its first and second SDG bonds in Europe, including its first tier 2 capital SDG bond in November 2019.

ANZ launched and priced its first SDG bond in the European wholesale debt capital markets in February 2018, raising 750 million euros (US$893 million) to fund its loans and expenditures that directly promote nine of the UN’s 17 SDGs. The bond was primarily distributed to European institutional investors with the proceeds supporting projects offering broad social, economic and environmental benefits, including funding for hospitals, schools, green buildings, clean water, public transport systems or renewable power plants.

ANZ has a A$50 billion SDG-linked commitment to fund and facilitate sustainable solutions for customers by 2025, including initiatives to help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial well-being. It replaced its previous A$15 billion low-carbon funding target set for 2020, which reached A$19.1 billion as at September 30 2019.","ANZ first bank to issue SDG bond in AustraliaTransaction uses the bank’s SDG bond framework, which links its asset base to certain UN SDGs20 Aug 2020 | Chito SantiagoANZ on August 20 announced the issue of a A$1.25 billion (US$893 million) tier 2 capital bond linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the first bank issued SDG bond in Australia’s domestic bond market.

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);

SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); and

SDG target 16.1 (violence), including homicide rates per 100,000, broken down by sex.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

Following up on the analytical framework used to develop this estimate, as published in ESCAP’s ‘Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2019: Ambitions beyond Growth,’ the Commission has now published a practical Guidebook to help policy makers and other stakeholders estimate their investment needs for implementing the SDGs.

Titled ‘A Guidebook for Assessing SDG Investment Needs,’ the publication is paired with an online dashboard on SDG investment trends.

The Guidebook seeks to support countries in their implementation of Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs). It recommends that costing SDG implementation should be “viewed as an integral part of effective planning which could also help countries develop an ambitious yet realistic financing strategy.” It further highlights that the “process of identifying interventions to be costed, their intended beneficiaries and the responsible service providers could result in improved policy design and implementation.” This result would occur if, for example, an SDG-related intervention cuts across the mandates of multiple government ministries and agencies and thus requires coordination from multiple actors to clarify responsibilities.

The Guidebook notes that costing SDG implementation is different from other costing exercises due to what is being costed. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes universal access and leaving no one behind, which should be reflected in the costing of targets, scenarios and interventions. In addition, SDG costing should consider the interlinkages across the Goals. It notes that some targets do not include numerical outcomes, leaving room for each country to identify what is nationally appropriate.

The Guidebook provides a Goal by Goal evaluation of considerations to take into account when costing SDG implementation.

The resource titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Your Community Foundation: Guidebook and Toolkit,’ was developed with funding from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. It focuses on Canadian community foundations’ efforts to work in their own contexts, but also provides information for community organizations around the world.

The Guidebook introduces the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs, and the core principles embodied in them, namely universality, local-level action, leaving no one behind, interconnected and indivisible, and partnerships. It highlights that these principles are particularly relevant to community foundations, which seek to convene local actors, foster partnerships, and spark action to address the needs of diverse groups.

The Guidebook also includes information on Canada’s approach to advancing the SDGs nationally. Canada presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The following year, the Government of Canada released an interim report titled, ‘Towards Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy.’ This report identifies five national priorities: leadership, governance, and policy coherence; awareness, engagement, and partnership; accountability, transparency, and reporting; reconciliation and the 2030 Agenda; and investing in the SDGs.

The SDG Toolkit portion of the resource identifies practical approaches to align an organization’s work with the SDGs. It offers ideas for how a group can select the first steps to take, identify existing alignment with the SDGs, plan for future alignment, and learn from examples of other community foundations.

Among the interconnected challenges for organizations seeking to align with the SDGs, the resource identifies: time constraints, given that the SDGs have a tight deadline for action; and the need to learn a new “language,” build capacity and new partnerships, and break out of silos.

The CFC is also supporting community foundations working on the SDGs through its Vital Signs program, which is prioritizing the collection of data that aligns to the 2030 Agenda to make relevant and standardized indicators available to community foundations. The toolkit notes that, in 2021, community foundations will have the opportunity to use a digital platform to host and share community data aligned to the SDGs.","The Community Foundations of Canada (CFC) has developed a guidebook and toolkit that offers examples, ideas, and steps for aligning an organization’s work with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The joint publication titled, ‘Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation: Intersections between Public Health, Intellectual Property and Trade,’ provides an update since the first edition’s launch in 2013. The study presents new data on health, innovation trends in the pharmaceutical sector, and trade and tariffs relating to medical products, capturing insights from joint technical assistance activities and taking into account developments in intellectual property legislation and jurisprudence.

The study “draws practical lessons from experiences regarding how public health, IP, trade and competition rules all interact with each other in the broader context of the human rights dimension of health and the [SDGs].” Given recent rapid changes in these policy arenas due to COVID-19, a WTO landing page for the study notes that “a standalone section on COVID-19 was added at the start of the publication to map the multiple challenges posed by the pandemic in relation to the integrated health, trade and IP policy frameworks set out in the study,” given that the report had been completed prior to the virus’s outbreak.

The COVID-19 section points readers to specific chapters, sections, and sub-sections of the report, and provides additional relevant information on:

Meeting the demand for health technologies and medical services;

Preserving effective international trade;

The global IP system vis-à-vis the pandemic;

International initiatives to support research and development of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 technologies;

Regulatory responses; and

Efforts to ensure transparency.

International trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.

The study itself describes the need for policy coherence and the role of the three authoring institutions (Chapter 1), summarizes the policy landscape (Chapter 2), and offers detailed information on the issues that specifically pertain to medical innovation and the research and development landscape (Chapter 3) and access (Chapter 4). The report draws connections to the SDGs and means of implementation such as trade throughout. Chapter 2 highlights linkages to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals), and describes key elements of trade policy such as tariffs, government procurement rules, and free trade agreements (FTAs). Chapter 4 considers the impact of trade and trade policy on access to medicines and medical technologies.

Noting that “innovation cannot take place in isolation from concerns about access,” the study emphasizes the need to preserve the global trade’s integrity. It observes that “international trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.” Recognizing governments’ recent implementation of trade-restrictive emergency measures such as export restrictions, the report also stresses “the importance of well-functioning supply chains and the need to facilitate cross-border flows of vital medical supplies and services.”

With the EU, the US, China, and Switzerland accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total share of health-related product exports, the majority of the global community appears reliant on imports. The study notes that from 1995 to 2018, “substantial and widening variations in per capita imports of health-related products” have been observed in countries at different levels of development, “highlighting stark differences in access to medicines.” Acknowledging the global trade regime’s increasing complexity, the study points to the existence of WTO agreements such as, inter alia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) as establishing rules to ensure that tariffs and non-tariff measures “do not become discriminatory or [become] unnecessary trade barriers.”

The WTO, WHO, and WIPO Directors-General each provided video remarks to support the launch of the study. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted the importance of close collaboration between the agencies, and joint global efforts more broadly, while WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry emphasized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for the removal of barriers to access, highlighting “unaffordable prices, intellectual property barriers, unjustified tariffs and challenges in ensuring effective and efficient regulatory review,” but also pointed to “unprecedented investments in collaborative, not-for-profit research” to tackle the shared threat of COVID-19.

The release shows a continued drop in goods trade associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but hints at the early beginnings of stabilization.

The WTO publishes two sets of indicators, each launched in September 2019. The Goods Trade Barometer (formerly the World Trade Outlook Indicator) shows how the latest data points compare to short-term trends in goods trade, providing an indication of potential trajectory in the near future based on a variety of component indices that are combined into a single composite index. The Services Trade Barometer combines six component indices into a composite index to illustrate the current state of services prior to the release of official statistics. Each is intended to complement traditional trade statistics and forecasts.

An L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, recovery trajectory cannot be ruled out.

Each barometer is normalized for medium-term trends, with a score of 100 indicating growth in line with medium-term trends. Scores that exceed 100 indicate above-trend growth, and those below 100 show below-trend growth. Scores that deviate by more than 5 points are considered substantially above or below trend.

A WTO release notes that the latest Goods Trade Barometer’s composite score of 84.5 is 15.5 points below the baseline value of 100 for the index and down 18.6 points year-on-year. This scoring is generally consistent with the WTO’s June statistics, which imply a 14% drop in global trade volume between the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. While nearly all drivers of goods trade considered (export orders, automotive products, container shipping, air freight, electronic components, and raw materials) have declined, the WTO suggests that the indices “have held up relatively well” and that world trade in 2020 may be evolving in line with the less pessimistic scenario outlined in an April forecast. The release cautions however, that a “V-shaped” recovery is uncertain, and emphasizes the possibility of an “L-shaped” pathway where global trade levels out “well below its pre-pandemic trajectory.”

A methodology document notes that the Trade Goods Barometer is published quarterly, whereas the Services Trade Barometer is updated twice per year.

In all, Ontario secured up to $4 billion in emergency assistance for municipalities through the Safe Restart Agreement, which gives them the support and flexibility they need to protect the health and well-being of their communities, while continuing to deliver critical public services as the province continues on the path of economic recovery.

“This new funding will provide municipalities with the support they need to protect the health and well-being of the people of Ontario, while continuing to deliver critical public services,” added McDonell.

In addition to the support for municipalities, the government is providing over $660 million in the first phase of transit funding to the 110 municipalities with transit systems. The funding can be used to provide immediate relief from transit pressures, such as lower ridership, as well as for new costs due to COVID-19, such as enhanced cleaning and masks for staff.

Cornwall will receive an additional $687,352 in order to support transit operations. It was reported by city officials on Monday that Cornwall Transit ridership was now at 30 per cent due to the pandemic.

Evolving Role of Universities: Knowledge Keepers to Knowledge Implementers

Making quality education available at every stage of life is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development. It involves educating students on the necessity of sustainable development by integrating sustainable development issues into all aspects of teaching and research. This means reorienting the education system such that it brings people, planet, partnerships, peace and prosperity together.

The education system needs to equip students with the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes and values to create a sustainable future. Students are encouraged to cultivate critical and creative thinking skills, engage in authentic interdisciplinary learning activities and develop a value system that emphasises on social justice, and responsibility to self, others and the planet.

MIT-WPU Faculty of Sustainability Studies

MIT-WPU is a UNESCO Chair for Human Rights, Peace, Democracy & Tolerance and all its study programs & campus initiatives are developed with Scholastic Inputs from renowned academicians, researchers and industry experts. The study programs are guided by the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, value-based universal education and peace studies to create an effective learning framework known as ‘WPU Methodology’.

Futuristic Programs At MIT-WPU

Reading the pulse of changing global dynamics across Industry, Environment, Economy and Society, MIT-WPU has introduced some futuristic study programs that retain the strengths of conventional programs and focus on modern requirements. These programs are particularly designed to enable the learners to study and apply knowledge in a global context. MIT-WPU is the only university in India offering these programs guided by the 17 UN SDGs.

Some of these programs include:

Program Highlights

The above programs offered at MIT-WPU also provide exposure to International Forums, United Nations, United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP), UNICEF and IFAD. The university has further developed strong linkages with national agencies and boards such as, NITI Aayog, State Administrative Departments, Government District Agencies, Urban Livelihood Mission, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, State Forest Departments, Department of Science and Technology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.

Words on Bathroom Walls, based on the young-adult novel by Julia Walton and directed by Thor Freudenthal (Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters; Diary of a Wimpy Kid), is predictably more conventional than those films. I was reminded at times of The Fault in Our Stars, another YA adaptation about illness with low-key religious themes and a central relationship that morphs from platonic friendship into romance.

But compelling performances elevate the sometimes familiar material, along with a gratifyingly frank, therapeutic depiction of mental illness, in this case schizophrenia.

Adam Petrazelli (Plummer), a high-school senior, has trouble knowing what’s real and what isn’t. Like Russell Crowe’s John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, he’s orbited by a cast of supporting characters that only he can see and hear, representing various aspects of his psyche.

The film also echoes A Beautiful Mind in the protagonist’s struggle between the liberating and debilitating effects of medication. One of the major themes is that Adam has an illness but the illness is not him, though he discovers that attempts to control the illness may have consequences for parts of himself that he cares about.

John Nash did math; Adam cooks and finds liberation in the kitchen. His dreams of culinary school, though, are imperiled by his first psychotic break, an incident with supernatural horror-movie resonances that inconveniently strikes in chemistry class during his senior year of high school. Someone is hurt, and Adam is expelled.

His hopes to get his life back on track involve a convergence of two paths: an experimental drug study and a Catholic school named for St. Agatha, where he meets brainy, jaded Maya (Russell) and a taciturn priest named Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), whom Adam mostly encounters in the confessional, despite not believing in God.

Molly Parker (House of Cards) is utterly credible as Adam’s mother, Beth, a constant advocate for her son whose biggest challenge may be persuading him that they really are on the same team. Their quarrels are among the film’s most true-to-life elements. Walton Goggins (Ant-Man and the Wasp) is nicely ambiguous as Paul, Beth’s new boyfriend, whom Adam resents without in any way pining for his deadbeat dad. (Adam says his dad split over Adam’s illness, which he considered “a buzzkill for his creativity.”)

Maya is so gifted that she’s not only St. Agatha’s top student but also props up other students on the sly for cash, a “side hustle” leading to a legit gig as Adam’s tutor, paid by Adam’s grateful mom. Initially it seems Maya is drawn to Adam’s quirkiness as a kind of puzzle to be solved, and how long Adam will be able to keep his schizophrenia a secret from her and everyone else at St. Agatha’s is a key dramatic question.

Maya could have been a magic girlfriend existing to solve Adam’s problems, but the story gives her issues and secrets of that go some way toward giving her an arc of her own. I would have liked more of a third act for her, as well as more attention to the socioeconomic issues the film raises (particularly as regards questions like who gets expelled and who doesn’t).

Adam’s other defining “relationships” are with characters who don’t exist: benevolent Rebecca (Soul Surfer’s AnnaSophia Robb), decadent Joaquin (Devon Bostick) and the unnamed, bat-wielding Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian). There’s also a malicious, demonic voice that addresses Adam from the darkness behind doors left ajar, confronting him with anxieties and whatever thoughts would most torture him.

Like many literary adaptations, Words relies heavily on first-person voice-over narration. I’m told the book takes the form of a series of journal entries written by Adam for his therapist, whom he refuses to talk to, which the movie wisely adapts as in-person therapy sessions. (Adam speaks directly to the camera, and the therapist is never seen or heard.)

In the book, I guess, Adam’s exchanges in the confessional with Father Patrick would be a therapeutic breakthrough, a setting in which Adam is willing to talk directly about his problems to someone in a way he won’t talk to his therapist.

Since the film’s Adam does talk openly to his therapist, there’s a smaller significance to the confessional scenes, highlighted when Adam realizes with a sense of betrayal that everything he tells his therapist gets back to his mother. What Adam tells the priest in the box, on the other hand, stays between the two of them (and God, the priest adds, acknowledging that, since Adam doesn’t believe in God, from his point of view it’s just the two of them).

Father Patrick is a sympathetic figure, if not a model priest. He gives Adam absolution in their first encounter, which is obviously bogus since not only hasn’t Adam confessed anything or expressed contrition, we don’t even know if he was baptized. (In the book I understand Adam’s family are mostly lapsed Italian Catholics who still go to Mass for Easter.) More trivially, Father Patrick cites verses from 1 John and 2 Timothy without the initial number, as if he’s not entirely sure which epistle he wants.

Father Patrick ultimately explains to Adam that we need confession because acknowledging our flaws to others is important in overcoming them. That’s true, and while for Catholics there’s obviously a deeper religious significance to confession, it’s the truth Adam needs at the moment, and it sets up the climax. (Father Patrick does get to offer a real Christian prayer for Adam, so his faith isn’t entirely elided by psychology.)

The principal, Sister Catherine (Beth Grant, Jackie), is a more mixed figure, well-meaning but ultimately representing the small-minded failings of religious institutions.

In a striking early visualization of Adam’s psychosis, when Adam, Beth and Paul first go to St. Agatha to meet Sister Catherine, Adam sees the principal calmly talking in the midst of an increasingly out-of-control fire like the viral “This Is Fine/On Fire” dog.

It’s an early example of how Adam’s hallucinations are sometimes played for laughs, and while the visual suggestion of fiery perdition could be merely ironic and not rancorous, by the end of the film the latter take is more plausible.

For what it’s worth, it seems Adam in the book is much more antagonistic toward Catholicism than comes across in the film. Another notable omission: As in The Fault in Our Stars, the book depicts a transgressive first sexual encounter (the book’s Adam has sex for the first time with Maya while wearing a Jesus beard for a Stations of the Cross play; in The Fault in Our Stars the main characters have sex for the first time after kissing at the Anne Frank house). In the film the romance goes no further than a first kiss (and Jesus beards are not a thing).

The film’s insightful portrayal of mental illness and strong character moments exist in tension with the more clichéd genre elements. Halfway through I found myself rooting for the film to be the best version of itself, a sign that a film is working even when it’s not completely successful.

My favorite moment, which might also be the sneakiest, is the one in which the significance of the title is revealed. If the ending is too tidy and too conventional, there have been lots of endings like this for neurotypicals, and perhaps people with mental illness — and the people who love them — deserve some, too.

In a warmer world, decreasing crop yields and rising food prices are expected to strongly jeopardize the achievement of SDG 2 – ending global hunger. Climate change has consequences for food production worldwide, but there are clear differences between regions. Sufficient food is expected to remain available in the Northern hemisphere, while in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia, falling crop yields may lead to higher food prices and a sharp rise in hunger.

In our recent publication in Nature Climate Change, we find that world trade can relieve these regional differences and provide a way to reduce hunger risks under climate change. For example, if regions like Europe and Latin America where wheat and corn thrive increase their production and export food to regions under heavy pressure from the warming of the Earth, food shortages can be reduced.

Global Hunger by 2050

The State of Food and Nutrition Security in the World 2020 reports that globally almost 690 million people were at risk of hunger in 2019. Many factors determine how global hunger will develop in the future, including population growth and economic development, as demonstrated in a study in Environmental Research Letters. Our article uses the “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic pathway where population reaches 9.2 billion, income grows according to historical trends, and the number of undernourished people decreases to 122 million by 2050. Within this socioeconomic setting, we investigate the impact of different climate change scenarios and trade policies on global hunger by 2050.

The worst-case climate scenario of a 4°C warming leads to an extra 55 million people enduring hunger – a 45% increase compared to the situation without climate change. In a protectionist trade environment where vulnerable regions cannot increase their food imports as a response to climate impacts, this effect rises to 73 million. The largest hunger risks are located in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with respectively a 33 million and 15 million increase in people at risk of hunger in the worst-case climate scenario.

Where barriers to trade are eliminated, “only” 20 million people endure food shortages due to climate change. While this number is high, it is a vast improvement on the 73 million people that would potentially be exposed to hunger without the suggested measures. In the milder climate change scenarios, an intensive liberalization of trade may prevent even more people from enduring hunger owing to global warming. Yet a liberalization of international trade may also involve potential dangers. If Asian countries increase rice exports without making more imports of other products possible, they could well end up with a food shortage within their own borders.

Mobilizing Investment

Our study shows not only that the challenge of ending global hunger is strongly determined by the extent of progress on SDG 13 (climate action), but also that achievement of SDG 2 (zero hunger) is affected by developments articulated in SDG 9 (resilient infrastructure). We find that international trade can relieve regional food shortages and reduce hunger, particularly where trade barriers are eliminated. Such trade integration requires phasing out import tariffs as well as the facilitation of trade through investment in transport infrastructure and technology. Especially in low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa infrastructure is weak. In its 2018 African Economic Outlook, the African Development Bank (AfDB) estimates that between USD 130 billion and 170 billion a year is needed to bridge the infrastructure gap in the region by 2025. Given that infrastructure finance averaged only USD 75 billion in recent years, and the largest contribution is coming from budget-constrained national governments, alternative financing through institutional and private investments could be crucial in the face of climate change.

Crisis and Protectionism

In times of crisis, countries are inclined to adopt a protectionist stance. For example, in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have temporarily closed their borders for the export of important food crops (see IFPRI Food Trade Policy Tracker for updated information). Some commentators warn that such measures can have large detrimental effects on food security. Our study finds that also in the context of climate change, a well-thought-out liberalization of trade is needed in order to be able to relieve food shortages properly.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected modalities of delivery of capacity-development activities around the world. Like many other organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) had to quickly adapt face-to-face training contents to the online environment. Some critical components of capacity-development activities needed to be carefully evaluated in order to identify the right format, volume, and overall feasibility of delivery considering the fact that learning would be conducted virtually and across various time zones.

FAO is the custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators and a contributing agency for a further five. In this capacity, FAO is supporting countries’ efforts in monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. FAO’s Land and Water Division is leading the work related to indicators 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency over time) and 6.4.2 (Level of water stress), using the AQUASTAT database for data collection and management.

One project, ‘Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 – IMI-SDG6,’ carried out by FAO, along with other UN agencies, and coordinated by UN-Water. Together with data collection and reporting, its main objective at this stage is to support countries to increase their technical and institutional capacity for the monitoring of the indicators related to Goal 6 targets (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all).

In the pre-COVID-19 era, face-to-face regional and national workshops and trainings represented the key modality for the delivery of capacity-development support under the project, due to the high level of interactivity, the possibility of direct exchange of experience and knowledge, as well as the networking potential among participants. Distant learning tools were then used to complement face-to-face interaction and to offer support in situations when a physical meeting was not possible. In most cases however, distance learning tools were used to target single individuals or small groups of participants.

The global pandemic, which caused the cancellation of scheduled face-to-face activities, served as a catalyst, stimulating and accelerating a global shift towards an effective and robust distance learning highway. What made this possible is not only organizational adaptation to the new conditions but also the ability and willingness of the audiences worldwide to take advantage of distance learning tools, overcoming their limitations.

At FAO, we had to change our mindset, and design and implement online capacity-development activities having such a level of scale and degree of interactivity as to be able to continue supporting countries’ SDG monitoring efforts. As a result, in June and July 2020, we organized two five-week regional interactive online courses on monitoring SDG indicators on sustainable water use: one, in Spanish, for Latin American countries and the other, in English, for countries in South and South-East Asia. More than 200 water monitoring and management professionals and statisticians from 33 countries participated in the courses, offering positive feedback on the module.

The courses consisted of five sessions, each lasting 100 minutes. The sessions included presentations by FAO staff, complemented by videos, polls, and question-and-answer exercises using the chat box of the teleconference platform. Each session concluded by highlighting recommended readings and exercises in preparation for the following session.

This delivery modality enabled us to reach many more relevant country staff than through in-person workshops, and strengthened the interaction within country teams as most of the exercises had been designed as country group work. We also noted significantly higher follow-up interaction between the participants and the FAO team than with face-to-face activities, most likely due to the fact that the courses had been conceived as online modules from the outset.

This experience has revealed that it is crucial to rethink the nature of capacity-development interventions, both from the side of the provider and the recipient. While face-to-face capacity-building activities remain an important element for IMI-SDG6 project, and will resume as soon as possible, interactive online courses have proven to be not just an emergency substitute but also an excellent complementary modality for capacity-development products’ delivery. The two modalities can be used to deliver different kinds of support: in-person activities are crucial in establishing relationships and in facilitating exchange of experience, while remote learning can be effective for addressing more technical subjects and for increasing the outreach and potential impact of our interventions. The online delivery modality will remain an integral component of the FAO IMI-SDG6 capacity-development portfolio, enriching the set of tools that we can put at our partners’ disposal.

FAO looks forward to using new tools to develop new capacities for reaching beneficiaries around the world to work together towards the achievement of the SDGs with an open mind, constantly adapting to the changing global conditions.

SAN FRANCISCO — The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a 7% increase in extreme poverty, with an additional 37 million people living below $1.90 a day, according to a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Devex @ UNGA 75 How is COVID-19 affecting progress on the SDGs? Will online meetings mean greater international representation? Our reporters are covering the all-virtual 75th United Nations General Assembly to find out.

The fourth annual Goalkeepers report, which launched on Monday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, draws on new data to provide what the Gates Foundation describes in a press release as “the most current global dataset for how the pandemic is affecting progress toward the Global Goals.”

In addition to quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the Sustainable Development Goals, Bill and Melinda Gates called for global collaboration on, and equitable delivery of, COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments in order to end the pandemic and get the SDGs back on track.

In its first three Goalkeepers reports, the Gates Foundation outlined steady progress on the SDGs, from reductions in malnutrition to improvements in literacy. But the 2020 report illustrates how COVID-19 has both stalled and reversed progress. For example, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Gates Foundation’s data partner in the Goalkeepers report, found that COVID-19 will cause vaccine coverage to drop to levels that were last seen in the 1990s.

“In other words, we’ve been set back about 25 years in about 25 weeks,” Bill and Melinda Gates note in the report, speaking to vaccine coverage, which they call “a good proxy for how health systems are functioning.”

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic. After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.” — Bill Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Bill Gates said he had just spent three hours on the phone with Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote about the ripple effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

“Other than South Africa and some countries in Northern Africa, the actual number of infections and deaths has not been large in Africa,” he said. “Sadly, as our report documents, there’s probably more negative effects on health because of the disruption to the health system including malaria bed nets, HIV drugs, TB drugs, and routine immunization or measles campaigns.”

In Africa, where most primary health care systems fell short of where they should be even before the pandemic, there is a particularly urgent need for progress on the SDGs to resume, Bill Gates said.

The Gates Foundation has also spent time examining the implications of COVID-19 on agriculture and food security, said Rodger Voorhies, president of the Gates Foundation’s Global Growth & Opportunity Division.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the COVID-19 economic crisis is building on worsening climate stresses, as well as the locust infestation, to create unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, he said.

Due to the economic shocks of COVID-19, the number of people suffering from food insecurity is expected to increase by 83 to 132 million, Voorhies said, adding the Gates Foundation is still trying to get a grasp on the impact of the pandemic on hunger and nutrition.

While the Goalkeepers report is filled with charts of how the world is backsliding on nearly every SDG indicator the Gates Foundation measures, COVID-19 is likely to accelerate progress in one area: financial inclusion.

“Faced with the urgent need to get cash to people quickly while helping them maintain social distance, more than 130 governments have created or improved digital cash transfer programs,” the report explains.

As countries make these transactions easier for communities with high levels of poverty, it is critical they seize this moment to ensure that rising bank account ownership leads to meaningful financial inclusion, particularly for women, Voorhies said.

“How do we build back in a way that really targets the most vulnerable?” he asked. “We say in my group: ‘Everyone benefits from an economy that includes everyone.’ How do we turn that into a reality?”

The Goalkeepers report includes models demonstrating how, if countries buy up COVID-19 vaccines in order to protect their own people, they will extend the life of the pandemic globally.

Northeastern University ran two scenarios: one where 50 high-income countries received the first 2 billion doses out of 3 billion doses and another where all countries received the 3 billion doses proportional to their populations and regardless of their ability to pay.

The simulations conclude that twice as many people could die of COVID-19 if vaccines are not distributed equitably.

In the report, Bill and Melinda Gates describe the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a global collaboration focused on the development and distribution of tools to fight the pandemic, as “the most serious collaborative effort to end the pandemic to date.”

During the press call, Bill Gates applauded commitments by French President Emmanual Macron, German President Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and said the ACT Accelerator will be close to the funding it needs for procurement “once the U.S. shows its interest.”

Gates emphasized the need for more tools to fight COVID-19, but added that once those tools are available, the question becomes “how do we get the manufacturing and generosity up?”

Already aspirational, some SDG targets may need to be redefined, while others may be entirely out of reach — but the goals remain a critical framework for cooperation, Bill Gates also explained.

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic,” he said. “After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.”

But Bill Gates expressed concern about donor financing for the SDGs as countries turn inward to deal with the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters.

The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.

According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.

If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.

Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.

The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council announced that only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries have expressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’

It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

We are facing a planetary emergency – a nature crisis, a climate crisis, and an inequality crisis all at once. Yet the world’s level of ambition to tackle our nature crisis to date has been lackluster, with a recent report highlighting that the world has failed to achieve most of the global biodiversity ambitions that the world agreed to in 2010, as part of a decade-long strategic plan for nature.

The result of low levels of leadership and political will in implementing the global plan, along with ever increasing threats to ecosystem and biodiversity coming from economic sectors, has been predictable – a recent report on the state of biodiversity found that the world has lost 68% of all wildlife populations since 1970.

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global diversity framework requires eliminating “negative money.”

To fully respond to this emergency, we need bold ambition, commitment, and action at all levels, from local to global, and across different sectors and constituencies. We need a multi-pronged “whole-of-society approach” to redefine our relationship with nature towards constructing a nature-based planetary safety net.

This article provides updates on progress in five areas.

Committing to Financing Nature

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework will require a significant increase in financial resources from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue.

It also requires eliminating “negative money.” For example, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year as agriculture, fisheries, and other subsidies to incentivize activities that degrade or destroy nature. All told, the finance gap for protecting 30% of the planet is about USD700 billion a year. However, a new report shows that this finance gap is not as large as it seems – it accounts for just under one percent of global GDP, and is a tiny fraction of the USD5.2 trillion we spend in fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the benefits of protecting nature outweigh the costs by at least 5:1. The best investment ever!

Reversing Biodiversity Loss by 2030 Through Global Commitment

Global, national, and sub-national leaders can no longer ignore our planetary crisis. Indeed, more than 1,700 jurisdictions have already declared a climate emergency. Now world leaders have begun to mobilize around a pledge for nature. More than 50 heads of state have already signed a pledge for nature, and 30 more are in the process of endorsing.

Among other statements, this pledge includes a recognition of the nature crisis, and calls for an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. To accompany this commitment, the Club of Rome has developed a concrete plan to emerge from our emergency.

Creating a Nature-Based Planetary Safety Net

The year 2021 will see the agreement by the world’s governments on a bold biodiversity framework through 2030, with an eye towards a planet in harmony with nature by 2050.

Building on the indivisible relation between the wellbeing of people and the wellbeing of nature, the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) will begin by looking back to the past decade, identifying reasons for hope in national and local action on biodiversity. COP 15 will then look forward, identifying key elements required for achieving success, including bold political will, coherent and aligned government policies, integration and alignment of a wide range of economic sectors, adequate resource mobilization, and decisive action, among others.

Greening Covid-19 Recovery Efforts and Creating Green New Deals

COVID-19 has taught us that business as usual is no longer an option. This crisis highlights the socio-economic threats and costs posed by our planetary emergency, and offers an opportunity to accelerate the transition to more inclusive, greener, and more resilient economies. Decisions made now on how to stimulate growth, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and prevent the next pandemic will determine the future health, well-being, and stability of both people and the planet.

To take action, countries can:

“green” their stimulus packages and longer-term national recovery plans;

promote green public work programs;

redirect harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies;

integrate nature-climate concerns into agriculture, water resources, forestry, tourism, industry, mining, energy, and infrastructure; and

promote sustainable public/private finance and investments.

Mapping Nature for People and Planet

More than 2,200 satellites circle the earth, enabling humanity to monitor the planet in ways never imagined possible. Enabled by the UNDP-led UN Biodiversity Lab, governments are beginning to use spatial data from these satellites, and combine these datasets with local and national data to generate new insight.

Supported by UNDP, and with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Government of Sweden, and One Earth, five governments – Uganda, Costa Rica, Peru, Kazakhstan and Colombia – have initiated a new process, called Mapping Nature For People and Planet: Essential Life Support Areas. Using satellite data, local and national data, and the principles of systematic conservation planning, these governments are able to pinpoint where actions on nature protection, restoration, and sustainable management will help them meet their nature-dependent national development goals, especially for water, food, climate, livelihoods, safety, and biodiversity. As Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the new head of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Francis Ogwal, co-chair of the working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, explain in a recent blog, such maps are an essential component for planning, implementing, and monitoring bold ambition and action on nature.

2020 was supposed to be a ‘Super Year for Nature.’ But even though all major biodiversity events have been postponed or cancelled, the recent gains in these five trends give us reasons for hope. To learn more, and for a dose of hope, visit www.NatureForLifeHub.org.

It’s clear that we need urgent, transformative change to tackle the global nature crisis. In many cases, we already know the solutions. How to stop terrestrial biodiversity loss from habitat conversion is one such case, and it has implications for the entire SDG framework.

Last week, the UN Convention for Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 reported that of the 20 Aichi targets agreed in 2010, only six are being “partially achieved” by their 2020 deadline. The CBD warns that despite encouraging progress in several areas, the natural world is suffering badly and getting worse. Launched in the same week, WWF’s Living Planet Report found that the population sizes of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles have seen an average drop of 68% since 1970.

How can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while feeding a growing population?

The good news is that the scientific community has made great progress in defining the problem over the past decade; we now have a clear and robust evidence base showing the urgency of changing course. There has also been massive progress in scientifically defining what needs to be done. A prime example of this is our knowledge of how to halt and reverse terrestrial biodiversity loss from land use change.

A third recent study, published in Nature on 10 September, shows the possibility of halting and reversing terrestrial biodiversity loss caused by land use change.

Six Actions to Halt and Recover from Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss

The new study was led by David Leclere of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and involved 58 experts from across 46 institutions including the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). It projects that without further efforts to tackle habitat loss and degradation, global biodiversity decline will continue at a rate close to or greater than that for 1970-2010. Land use change, also known as habitat conversion, is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land. The researchers used ground-breaking modelling and newly developed scenarios to identify six actions needed to stop such losses. These are:

Sustainable increases in crop yields;

Trade increases in agricultural goods with reduced trade barriers;

Reducing the waste of agricultural goods from field to fork by 50%;

Cutting the share of animal calories in human diets by 50% except in regions in which the share of animal products in diets is already estimated to be low (the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and other Pacific Islands);

Increasing Protected Area extent to 40% terrestrial coverage, covering important sites for biodiversity and with improved management; and

Increasing restoration (reaching about 8% of terrestrial areas by 2050) and landscape-level conservation planning that balances production and conservation objectives on all managed land.

By combining the six actions listed above in an integrated strategy, modelling shows that it is possible to avoid more than two thirds of future terrestrial biodiversity losses caused by land use change.

Protecting SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 15 (Life on Land) at the Same Time

The authors of the study considered seven different scenarios to explore whether we could achieve this without undermining other SDGs. In particular, how can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while also feeding a growing population?

Without transformation of the food system, bold conservation efforts could conflict with future food provision by raising food prices. The conservation efforts alone would also not be enough to stop the losses by 2050. In order to achieve this and reduce potential negative impacts on food security, conservation efforts should be combined with simultaneous transformation of food systems, as well as wider action on other drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and biological invasions.

Such transformative change in food and land use systems would also have valuable co-benefits that contribute to other SDGs, such as SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing).

Implications for International Policy

This is the first time that the key combined actions needed to stop and reverse biodiversity loss on land have been identified and backed by robust futures modelling. This research sets out clear and ambitious actions for governments, businesses, and consumers to take on board.

The next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2021 (COP 15) is expected to agree a set of new international goals and targets as part of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework to take us through to 2050. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework will be a critical opportunity to stop biodiversity loss and ensure that people continue to benefit from biodiversity into the future. But for this framework to be effective, it must incorporate bold conservation and restoration efforts as well as food system transformation. Together these can help to tackle the drivers of terrestrial biodiversity loss.

Heads of State and Government will consider the policy menu at a high-level event on 29 September 2020.

Just like people with pre-existing conditions, countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19.

Speakers explained that developing countries are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many ways. As Ghana’s minister for finance said, the pandemic’s effects on Africa are “not a passing frigate, but a … dislocation of at least three years.”

Among the examples given:

Fiji has no active cases of COVID-19, but has lost revenue due to tourism and remittance declines. Similarly, the Maldives felt economic impacts of the pandemic before a case of COVID-19 was discovered locally, as it had to stop tourism for over three months – “the engine of our economic growth.”

Ghana could lose USD 1 billion through illicit financial flows, which is more than its entire health budget.

South Africa has the same debt-to-GDP ratio as Germany, but South Africa’s debt service payments are 4% of its GDP, while Germany’s are 0.7%. “This cannot be the right thing to do” in a time of such dire need, said Vera Songwe, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). High debt payments mean compromising test kits, tracing programmes, and acquiring vaccines.

Africa has no reserve currency, and will need USD 100billion/year to begin recovery.

The meeting on 8 September 2020 was convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and the finance ministers of Canada and Jamaica. Opening the meeting, the two convening ministers stressed the need for a multilateral response to the pandemic and the related economic crisis. Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance of Canada, acknowledged that the least developed countries (LDCs) feel the effects most acutely, lacking the resources to adopt recovery measures. Nigel Clarke, Minister of Finance of Jamaica, said the need for a global response to the pandemic has only increased, as its center of gravity has shifted to developing countries.

International officials then highlighted economic trends resulting from the pandemic, three priorities for policy makers, and the menu of policy options. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19, just like people with pre-existing conditions. She said countries that already had high debt levels are in terrible trouble, and tourism-dependent economies “are on their knees.” The priorities now are to: maintain support for these countries until their economies are fully turned around; extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) for another year; and invest in education, digital capacity, human capital, health systems, and social protection.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, said the menu of policy options provides measures for emergency response, recovery, and stability. Emergency mobilization measures could include extending and broadening the DSSI, declaring remittance services essential, and extending debt swap lines and special drawing rights (SDRs). Sustainable and inclusive recovering measures could include debt cancellations, debt-for-climate or debt-for-SDG swaps, and scaling up social protection and health coverage. Policy options for enabling a sustainable and resilient future including adopting climate-related financial risk disclosures, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and integrating the SDGs into national budgets.

Members of six discussion groups presented key findings of their work in June, July and August 2020, which generated the menu of policy options. For the group on external finance, remittances, jobs, and inclusive growth (Group 1), Japan reported that the G20 and Paris Club have agreed on an extension of the DSSI, and called for private sector funding. China announced that it is actively considering the DSSI extension. Egypt supported debt equity swaps to finance SDG-related investment.

On recovering better for sustainability (Group 2), the European Commissioner for Crisis Management stressed the need for a “green, digital, just, and resilient” recovery. Related policy options would support strong health systems, resource-efficient growth, and an open and secure digital society. He said this requires both public and private investment to fully align with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Rwanda said that in addition to an extended DSSI, developing countries also need: adjustments to the DSSI terms, debt restructuring, a replenished IDA 20, and access to financial markets at zero cost. “This is the road map” to recover better.

The UK said countries’ recovery plans should incorporate updated and enhanced climate NDCs, and they should align spending with the Paris Agreement. The UK will host the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021 (UNFCCC COP 26).

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) said digitalization can help mobilize finance and is a lifeline in this crisis. The International Development Finance Club (IDFC) said public development banks (PDBs) can help bridge the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and local policies, and momentum us growing between PDBs and stakeholders. IDFC announced that it will hold the ‘Finance in Common Summit’ on 12 November 2020, the first global meeting for all PDBs.

On global liquidity and financial stability (Group 3), Costa Rica announced a proposal for a USD 1 trillion fund to support emerging and poor countries with concessional loans for COVID-19 impacts. The World Bank echoed the importance of concessionality. Ghana said the SDR system should be extended. He cited a “disaster waiting to happen [in 2021] as countries begin to default.”

France and the World Bank indicated support for extending the DSSI. The World Bank added that more participation is needed from the private sector.

The Maldives proposed a tourism fund to ramp up testing in airports to restore trust in global travel. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) recommended a liquidity and sustainability facility to bring down the rates for debt service payments.

On debt vulnerability (Group 4), Pakistan said participation in the DSSI should not affect credit ratings. The African Union (AU) Commission said extending the DSSI is critical: “African countries need liquidity.”

The US said the G20 and Paris Club could consider further steps in 2021, depending on countries’ actions in the meantime, such as improving public financial management and directing investment to projects that strengthen economic growth).

The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) called or a debt swap for climate change to create a Caribbean resilience fund, which would require 12% of the total public debt (USD 7 billion).

On private sector creditors engagement (Group 5), Senegal said private sector DSSI might be relevant for certain countries, but it is not relevant for all, and “certainly not for Senegal.” Instead, it would “kick the can down the road” for countries that already have expensive commercial debt. Official debt cancellation will be needed for some countries, he stressed.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the aftermath of COVID-19 for developing countries – hunger, starvation, and poverty – will make its health consequences look very small.

Finally, on illicit financial flows (IFFs) (Group 6), Nigeria called for mutual legal assistance to address barriers to international cooperation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATAF) reported that the pandemic has been used to generate illicit funds, which are now flowing out of developing countries just when health services need it most. The solution is to implement the FATAF standards, he suggested.

Oxfam endorsed the recommendation to support the Addis Tax Initiative’s (ATI) 2020 mandate, and called for a UN tax convention to address tax havens, tax abuse, and other IFFs.

The ministers’ meeting will be followed by a Meeting of Heads and State and Government on 29 September to consider the policy options, and a series of thematic and regional meetings from October to December.

A follow-up meeting in December 2020 is being planned in order to benchmark progress in the context of the Decade of SDG Action.

The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Summit, Agnes Kalibata, said five “action tracks” are at the center of the preparatory process.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who organized the briefing on 4 September 2020, said transforming food systems will be central to achieving the SDGs. The Summit will be a “foundational element” of the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs by 2030, Mohammed noted, citing the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report’s finding that food systems and nutrition are key entry points for getting the world on a more sustainable trajectory.

The five action tracks will develop “exemplary, game-changing, and systemic solutions.”

Kalibata said the Summit aims to raise public discourse around food systems and what we can do differently. More specifically, it will have five interconnected objectives:

Ensure access to safe, nutritious food for all; Shift to sustainable consumption patterns by reducing waste and creating demand for healthy diets; Boost “nature-positive production,” entailing reduced emissions and energy usage and protection of ecosystems; Advance equitable livelihoods, including raising incomes and promoting decent work; and Build resilience to vulnerabilities and shocks.

An action track is being established in each of these areas. The action tracks will be charged with developing “exemplary, game-changing, and systemic solutions.” Each track will include participants from the global north, the global south, and youth. The organizers are seeking expressions of interest in the five action tracks by 30 September 2020.

To make the event “both a people’s summit and a solutions summit,” several additional work streams and support structures are being established. As announced in June 2020, these include:

Advisory Committee chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General, to provide strategic guidance; includes two Member States from each region, as well as senior officials of relevant UN agencies and other international organizations, and individual experts (farmers, indigenous peoples, civil society, researchers, academics, youth, business leaders);

Scientific Group to ensure that the science underpinning the Summit and its outcomes is robust, broad, and independent, and provide analyses of trade-offs faced by food system actors;

Champions Network to mobilize a large, diverse group of stakeholders to call for transformation of the world’s food systems, and facilitate coordinated action

UN Task Force to ensure the Summit builds on knowledge of entire UN system

Initial meetings have taken place for the Advisory Committee, the Scientific Group, and the UN Task Force. The Champions Network will be opened on World Food Day 2020.

National dialogues on food systems also will take place ahead of the Summit.

The Summit is currently anticipated to convene in September or October 2021. According to the organizers, the “best case scenario” is gathering Heads of State and leaders from around the world, but the Summit should also be prepared to take place virtually or in a hybrid format with one or more small, in-person events.

The Food Systems Summit is expected to result in a high-level call to action and a system of follow-up and review. It is being convened by the UN Secretary-General. The Rome-based UN agencies (World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and International Fund for Agricultural Development) are playing a leading role in organizing the event and the preparatory roadmap.

Leading up to the 2020 HLPF session, UN Member States attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration to be adopted during the HLPF’s closing session. However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that this has become the norm, but if the meeting had been taking place in person, governments would have been able to adopt it by a vote. “In the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was found.

On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”

In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.

Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.

The CBD Secretariat launched the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) on 15 September 2020, during the first of four days of ‘Special Virtual Sessions’ taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to the eight transition areas, GBO-5 reviews progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) in October 2010, and were set for the 2011-2020 period. GBO-5 draws on indicators, research studies, and assessments, including the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as national reports submitted to the CBD.

Conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions, among other areas of progress reported in GBO-5.

The report highlights ten areas in which progress can be viewed:

almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems;

the rate of deforestation has fallen globally by about one-third compared to the previous decade;

where good fisheries management policies have been introduced, the abundance of marine fish stocks has been maintained or rebuilt;

an increasing number of successful cases of eradication of invasive alien species from islands has been reported;

a significant expansion of protected area has been reported;

conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions;

the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization has come into force and is fully operational in at least 87 countries and internationally;

national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) have been updated in line with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by 170 countries (85% of CBD Parties);

there has been an increase in the available data and information on biodiversity; and

financial resources available for biodiversity through international flows have doubled.

The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” that draws on efforts related to: enhanced conservation and restoration of ecosystems; climate change mitigation; action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation; more sustainable production of goods and services; and reduced consumption and waste.

Also highlighted during the launch event was the second edition of the Local Biodiversity Outlooks (LBO-2). LBO-2 focuses on local biodiversity and stories of resilience among indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). It proposes six transition areas aligned with GBO-5:

Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being;

Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure of IPLCs;

Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development;

Incentives and financial transitions towards rewarding effective culturebased solutions;

Economic transitions towards sustainable use and diverse local economies; and

Food transitions towards revitalising indigenous and local food systems.

Joji Carino, Forest Peoples Programme, launched the report as part of the 15 September event. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, Carino said IPLCs are underrepresented in national strategies and action plans, “despite agreement that putting culture and the rights of IPLCs at the heart of biodiversity strategy can bring about positive outcomes.”

The event also launched a review of progress towards the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020.

Examples from around the world highlight the use of data to make better decisions, such as to find the best locations to resettled endangered rhinos in Kenya.

The report titled, ‘A Global Movement for Better Data and Better Lives: Five years of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, 2015-2020,’ reflects on the Partnership’s five years of learning and shares experience on how to build a better data system. The authors highlight five key lessons:

“Good data takes time”: time is needed to build relationships, change institutions, and learn; commitments must be long-term, and planning and budgeting need to be based on a long-term perspective embedded within a supportive institutional framework;

“Progress depends on people”: understanding and trust are key to good partnerships; building common understanding and agreeing on common goals can help mediate between different organizations;

“Politics drives technical change” and political support is key to achieve sustainable change at scale; South-South cooperation should be used as a lever for change;

“Values count”: equity and inclusivity are critical to data progress; data should be inclusive in form and function, and new capacities and skills are needed to respond to unforeseen phenomena and complex data issues; and

“Systems not silos”: openness and interoperability strengthen data systems and increase impact; data has the most value when it can be combined and used in different systems; open data, platforms, and tools make systems fair and flexible, facilitating innovation and spreading knowledge.

The report shares how partnerships across government, the private sector, civil society, and academia are using data for better decisions, based on the principles of local ownership and sustainability. Examples include:

In Kenya, wildlife conservation groups are leveraging improved data and technology to find the best locations for resettling endangered rhinos;

In Colombia and Paraguay, government partners have developed new methods of SDG monitoring to allow countries around the world to better measure progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

In Nigeria, the government created a COVID-19 dashboard that combines data from government agencies to track COVID-19 cases and health center availability;

In Sierra Leone, the government is using data and technology to better protect its mangrove forests; and

In Senegal, farmers can get prices for their crops more quickly at harvest time.

Similarly, the report showcases how better data are improving the lives of the poorest people in the world. The statistics office in Colombia is accounting for gender, disability, ethnicity, and life cycle to create a fuller understanding of people’s needs in data. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center published the first global estimate of the number of internally displaced women and children. In Zanzibar, the government is using data to understand gendered dimensions of crime and migration.

Among the report’s highlights of how the Partnership has contributed to systemic changes, responsible data sharing and innovation, in 2018, it produced a guide on data interoperability that draws on learning from over 100 partners and is informing practice in nine countries. To increase funding for data, the Partnership collaborated with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, and several governments to launch the 50×2030 initiative in 2018, which aims to bridge the global agricultural data gap by transforming country data systems across 50 countries by 2030.

Looking forward, the report notes that the Partnership aims to build regional and national partnerships to strengthen systems, build capacity, and learn what works to ensure that better data can be used to improve decisions and scale up successful experiments.

The Global Partnership, a network of 260 partners from 59 countries across 111 cities, launched the report at a global town hall event on 25 September 2020 to mark its fifth anniversary. Also on 25 September, Global Goals Day, the Partnership marked the fifth anniversary of the SDGs’ adoption in 2015 with a focus on “factivism,” drawing attention to the action needed by everyone to deliver the Goals by 2030.

The project will seek to increase investment in nature-based infrastructure that can help adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The project, which was announced on 31 July 2020, will use financial modelling and climate change projections to establish the business case for investing in nature. The project partners report that they will provide decision-makers with comprehensive, system-wide valuations of natural assets, reflecting not only capital and operating costs, but also co-benefits from carbon sequestration, air purification, protection against water scarcity, and climate change adaptation. They will also provide cost comparisons with grey infrastructure alternatives.

Many decision-makers do not have the tools to compare green or hybrid infrastructure solutions with alternatives when making decisions about flood control, food security, coastal protection, water conservation, and wastewater treatment. The project partners highlight the increased importance of such information as countries plan their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and work toward global climate change, biodiversity, and other goals and frameworks.

The initiative is supported by the GEF-managed Special Climate Change Fund. It is co-financed by the MAVA Foundation. The implementing agency is the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) will execute the initiative, which will use IISD’s modelling tool for analyzing the costs of externalities of infrastructure projects (Sustainable Asset Valuation, or SAVi). Unlike traditional financial valuations of infrastructure projects, SAVi places a financial value on economic, social, and environmental risks and shows how these risks affect the financial performance of infrastructure projects and portfolios across their life cycles.

The project will use data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, and will include a public online database on the valuation and performance of nature-based infrastructure.

The meeting aimed to set a work plan for 2021, the last year in a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Convention, among other objectives.

The Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) guides work between meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP). Building on outcomes of the 19th COP in 2019, the 12th meeting of the OEWG convened for the first of two segments – an online segment on 1 and 3 September 2020 (with 2 September featuring online side events on legal issues for the Convention). The second segment is expected to be an in-person segment in March 2021. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the online segment of OEWG12 “paved the way for quick decisions at the March 2021 face-to-face segment, if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.”

The OEWG worked to advance technical guidelines on:

wastes containing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury;

incineration on land and on specially engineered landfills; and

the identification and environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic wastes and their disposal.

Participants also followed up on actions taken in 2019: amending the Basel Convention annexes to deal with plastic waste, and creating a new Plastic Waste Partnership. In his address to OEWG12, Basel Convention Executive Secretary Rolph Payet pleaded with parties not to backtrack on their commitments to reduce single-use plastics and to renew efforts in this regard.

In the discussion, countries differed over whether they should further address upstream matters on preventing plastic waste. They also considered the value of an effectiveness assessment of action so far. The ENB reports that intervening parties supported vigorous follow-up to the 2019 amendment and the work of the Plastic Waste Partnership, but several expressed concern whether an effectiveness assessment is premature.

As explained by the ENB, OEWG12 still needs to decide the fate of an update of the technical guidelines on plastic waste, guidance on creating national inventories on plastic waste, a report on possible future activities on the issue under the Convention, the status of the Plastic Waste Partnership, and a proposal to the World Customs Organization to amend the Harmonized System to identify plastic wastes.

The OEWG also discussed technical guidelines on transboundary movements of e-waste and used electrical and electronic equipment, which were adopted in 2019. A deadline of 30 October 2020 is in place for parties to use and test the guidelines. Two countries introduced a proposal to make all e-waste shipments (whether or not considered hazardous) subject to the prior informed consent procedure. While some parties expressed support for the idea, several observers raised concerns that it would not improve the e-waste trade situation and would not support the transition towards a circular economy.

On ESM of waste lead-acid batteries, many participants indicated an urgent need to update the technical guidelines.

The Group also spent time on a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Basel Convention (2012-2021), which will end next year. The Group reviewed the status of the draft report on the evaluation of this framework.

Per the ENB, as the online segment closed, OEWG12 still needed to reach agreement on a number of proposals to improve Convention implementation before COP15:

recommendations of the evaluation of the Strategic Framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention;

a practical manual for stakeholders to ensure that notifications of transboundary movements meet ESM requirements under the Convention;

recommendations for possible amendment proposals to the Convention’s annexes;

options for a system under the Convention to allow the automation of processes and the electronic exchange of information relating to the notification and movement of hazardous and other wastes; and

practical manuals on preparing national inventories on priority waste streams.

OEWG12 is now suspended. It plans to reconvene at a face-to-face meeting in March 2021, in Nairobi, Kenya (back-to-back with the fifth UN Environment Assembly, UNEA-5). This tentative plan is subject to the availability of resources and a positive development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outcomes of the deliberations of the OEWG will be transmitted to COP 15, scheduled to be held back-to-back with the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention (RC COP-10) and the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention (SC COP-10) from 19-30 July 2021, in Geneva, Switzerland. The collective theme of the meetings will be ‘Global Agreements for a Healthy Planet: Sound management of chemicals and waste.’ [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of OEWG 12] [Basel Convention website]","A working group of government representatives convened virtually to discuss several items on the agenda for the Basel Convention on the movement and disposal of hazardous wastes.

WASHINGTON — With elusive progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in fragile contexts drastically compromised by COVID-19, there is a critical need for effective aid spending, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “States of Fragility 2020” report.

The annual report examined the most fragile contexts in 2020 in two parts: the global state of fragility before the virus struck, and how the resulting pandemic is dramatically impacting that landscape. It examines fragile state progress on the SDGs, and reviews levels of finance available to support them, calling for urgent action by OECD countries to maintain official development assistance levels, support access to other types of financing, and promote policies for fragile contexts.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment ...” — Susanna Moorehead, chair, OECD Development Assistance Committee

Of those living in extreme poverty globally, 76.5% live in fragile contexts — representing 23% of the world’s population. Only small improvements were found in the 2020 analysis of 57 countries and territories, and they are expected to be jeopardized by COVID-19, which has contributed to mass unemployment, increased poverty, heightened inequalities, political unrest, and rising gender-based violence.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health, economic, and social crisis without precedent in living memory. It’s also revealed the immense importance of strong states, efficient governments, and solid social security systems to confront the pandemic,” said Jorge Moreira da Silva, director of the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate, at a launch event on Thursday. “The early estimates, using the most recent projections from the World Bank, suggest that the pandemic will result in 26 million additional people in fragile contexts falling into extreme poverty by the end of this year.”

How off track are the SDGs, exactly? We don't know, but it might not matter Lagging official data makes it challenging to have an up-to-date picture of the pandemic's impact on the SDGs. But it is clear that the goals require renewed support and financing, experts explain ahead of the U.N. General Assembly.

Susanna Moorehead, OECD Development Assistance Committee chair, called the numbers in the report “terrifying” and said the figures show that poverty reduction is not merely off-track, but in reverse. She said DAC must mobilize political momentum and resources for fragile countries by spending ODA more wisely and making funds go further.

In 2018, $76 billion in bilateral ODA went to fragile contexts — more than ever before. After remittances, ODA is the second largest form of external finance to fragile countries, and it has increased every year since 2014.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment … Official development assistance is under enormous pressure and it is certain that demand will outstrip supply,” Moorehead said. “You only have to think about the humanitarian burden that the world’s facing, and it is DAC donors who will pick up a very substantial part of the costs of that over the course of the next year or so. But fragility, we know, is expensive … if you don’t invest in stability, it costs you more.”

Making ODA more effective means making sure the international community is coordinating assistance and that there is less competition between agencies. It also requires a focus on programs that prioritize resilience and investment in conflict prevention and peace building, she said.

Helder da Costa, general secretary of the g7+, a group of fragile states, said that despite the pandemic, ending active conflict and war around the world must remain the number one priority.

“Conflict prevention cannot and should not be summed up as compilation of ad hoc projects and activities funded and fragmented in analysis and theories. Pursuing stability that rests on a capable state, functioning institutions, and [a] vibrant economy should be our end,” da Costa said. “For the g7+ countries, we did not need a pandemic to learn this hard lesson. Our member countries have been living such a reality for decades.”

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said that the coronavirus has aggravated multiplied issues of fragility — the burden of which tends to disproportionately fall “on those who are already vulnerable and marginalized.” Before COVID-19, only 8 of the 48 fragile contexts where data is available were on track to meet SDG 1, ending poverty.

Thirteen of the countries examined in the report are categorized as extremely fragile, with the top five being Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 2012 and 2018, the gap in levels of fragility between the extremely fragile states and non-fragile contexts increased every year. In 11 of the 13 extremely fragile states, progress has stagnated on hunger and gender equality-related SDGs while in more than half of nonfragile contexts, progress is increasing or on track for meeting the goal.","“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else.

Deutsche Post DHL Group, Microsoft Corp. and the PwC network (“PwC”) have already joined the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility and the initiative is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to contribute.

The Global Facility is a response to corporate calls to action for private sector leaders and governments to work together to address the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The initiative has been established to better coordinate their responses, helping to ensure that immediate stimulus efforts flow into the real economy.

The Global Facility will operate at both the global and national levels. It aims to co-create solutions that are tailored to the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given area and the specificities of the local private sector and government context. Guided by the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Facility will support a multisectoral, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to face the multidimensional nature of the crisis. Recovery efforts will focus on how to rebuild more inclusive economies and societies, to set a new course for a socially just, low-carbon and climate-resilient world where no one is left behind. Initial projects will focus on the countries of Colombia, Ghana, the Philippines and Turkey. Both the geographical scope and participating partners will expand as the Global Facility develops.

“Solidarity to ‘Recover Better Together’ can boost our collective efforts not only to cope with the crisis but overcome it. UNDP’s footprint across some 170 countries and territories, combined with the UN Global Compact’s network of more than 10,000 companies and 68 Local Networks around the world, and the International Chamber of Commerce’s network of over 45 million companies, multiplies our collective capacity and potential. The Facility is the first of its kind – designed to join forces across public and private sectors to serve humanity in an imperative moment,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility was announced by Mr Steiner at the SDG Business Forum during the UN General Assembly, the largest and most inclusive UN convening of private sector leaders. Launched under the motto “Recover Better Together”, the timing of this initiative has special importance, marking the commemoration of some important UN-related milestones: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations; the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Compact; and the Centenary of ICC’s founding after WWI at a time when multilateralism is facing the greatest challenge of its generation.

Initiating partners

The Initiating Partners are UNDP, UN Global Compact and ICC. Together, they will bring their unique access to global expertise on responsible business practices, economic recovery, green business transformation and multi-hazard risk management.

“As COVID-19 disrupts societies, development agendas must adjust accordingly. There is a need for inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the critical contributions of civil society, business, foundations, the research community, local authorities, cities and regional governments. By unlocking public-private and private-private cooperation for a sustainable response to COVID-19 challenges, it is possible to recover better and build more resilient economies,” said Mr Steiner.

The private sector has been acutely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact affirm the belief that businesses exist to serve and advance their societies, and their success cannot come at the cost of social or environmental regression.

“It is a moment of human tragedy and intense economic and social upheaval. But it is also a moment of possibility. Through partnerships like the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility we will support companies to Recover Better Together from the pandemic and finally confront global inequality by taking action, as well as mitigate the worst impacts of a climate emergency that threatens all of humanity. Together we can construct a new paradigm of resilience,” saidSanda Ojiambo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced around 70% of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to shut down their operations. SMEs represent 50% of global GDP and more than 70% of global employment. The partners of the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility, representing multinational, global and local private sector stakeholders, commit to joint projects to develop policy and financial solutions for pandemic relief.

ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said: “ICC’s local networks can bring value to the cooperation by reaching small business owners who want to have their challenges understood, their ideas heard, and their efforts to Recover Better recognised and built upon by others. SMEs need a way to facilitate this vital exchange of ideas, learning and experience with each other and with organisations and institutions in a position to support them.”

﻿

Private sector involvement

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility is supported by strategic partners DHL, Microsoft and PwC, and is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to join this initiative. The strategic partners will add their expertise and technology to support this transformational recovery.

“In the current situation our employees recognize more than ever before their contribution to the well-being of the population. Under extremely difficult circumstances Deutsche Post DHL Group kept the global flow of goods, secured supply chains and provided the world with the necessary protective equipment. We want to share our experience of operating during one of the biggest health crises in recent history to protect lives against the pandemic. Join our efforts of connecting people improving lives to address the upcoming challenges together with our long standing partner UNDP,” said Monika Schaller, EVP Group Communications, Sustainability and Brand.

Deutsche Post DHL Group embarked upon the idea to support the Global Facility before its launch. The company underlined that their world-wide network enables them to make a difference on the ground for the local SMEs and helps them to survive in the present situation by solving logistical constraints.

“In line with Microsoft’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, we firmly believe technology can be a force for good in these challenging times and we’re proud to partner with public and private sector partners in an effort to accelerate global recovery. We see The Global Facility as an opportunity to create economic opportunities for all, bring our sustainability investments forward to support growth and recovery in a manner that advances our shared environmental agendas, and use data and AI to a build a system of intelligence to help all stakeholders better target their efforts to the communities that need the most help.” said Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft VP and Global Head of Tech for Social Impact.

Firms from the global professional services network PwC joined the initiative at its conceptual stage with UNDP. PwC will continue to play an instrumental role in supporting the design and establishment of this flagship global public-private cooperation. Additionally, PwC will help to develop finance and policy solutions and coordinate multistakeholder engagement. PwC’s role in the Global Facility is led by PwC Poland and supported by PwC Canada, PwC Hungary, PwC India, PwC Norway, PwC Middle East, PwC Switzerland, PwC Turkey and PwC UK.

“At PwC, our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Together with our clients and communities, we are working to assess and mitigate the major challenges that the pandemic poses for our economies and societies. We are proud to be working with our public and private sector partners to help structure and implement real pandemic relief solutions that make a difference in people’s lives,” said Agnieszka Gajewska, PwC Poland Partner, CEE Public Sector and Infrastructure Leader.

In order to effectively reach the most vulnerable in the most efficient ways, the facility aims to expand the list of strategic partners.

According to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals and Investment, Mrs Solape Hammond, the endeavour is a symbol of the State’s strong leadership, vision and commitment towards greater development.

Hammond also stressed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s spirited resolve to address the development needs of Lagosians, particularly in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

“The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has heightened the call for renewed dedication to sustainable development by governments at various levels, which Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has taken as a great priority and infused in the state’s development agenda codenamed THEMES (Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism as well as Security and Governance).

“While the pandemic has significantly exacerbated some of the problems Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are set to solve, it has also triggered the necessity for more concerted actions in addressing many developmental issues troubling our world,” she asserted.

Hammond disclosed that the event, in commemoration of the United Nations’ Global Goals Week, will run till the end of September 2020, and will mobilise collaborative efforts to connect SDGs actors and cross-sector stakeholders with a view to identifying solutions, reviewing progress, amplifying awareness, collaborating and reaffirming commitment towards accelerating efforts to achieve the 17 SDGs and the 2030 agenda.

She explained that the State Government is setting lofty precedence in the country, and perhaps in Africa by effectively mobilising individual action towards the attainment of the SDGs, and added that the administration would continue to drive, extract and utilise available platforms towards improving the living standard of the people.

In his remark, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on SDGs, Mr. Lekan Fatodu, said the focus is to double up our efforts and galvanise more actions towards the attainment of the global goals.

“Lagos State is reputable for audacious strides and accomplishments. And these remarkable traits are consistently being brought to bear in our approaches towards realising the SDGs. This maiden SDGs Week is a clear demonstration of our acknowledgement of many dynamic and relevant ways of amplifying the significance of the SDGs and, more importantly, a strategic way of identifying and attracting passionate drivers of the SDGs in Lagos State to join hands towards achieving the goals.

“The effort to reach everybody, including the most vulnerable and marginalized, requires strong community and citizen engagement and organic participation. This strategy holds great value as we approach the last decade of SDGs,” he affirmed.

Fatodu further stated that “the Sustainable Development Goal Week is a proactive and ground-breaking initiative to implement joint efforts towards meeting the targets and indicators of the SDGs”.

While applauding the unalloyed contributions of prominent individuals, Corporate Institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Governor’s aide revealed that “the initiative will further bring to fore the need for urgent and collective effort towards finding sustainable solutions to current and impending challenges facing humanity”.

The SDGs week will feature sustainable development-related activities that are intrinsically linked in their purpose to fast-track efforts towards progress in realizing the SDGs. Some of these activities include the Open Goals Adoption by top state functionaries and prominent Lagos residents, the Neighbourhood Outreach Campaign to enlighten citizens on their roles in achieving the Goals and an SDGs discourse with CSOs and youth groups that are focused on the SDGs.

The highlight of the week will be the distribution of support items and relief materials donated by corporate organisations and well-meaning Lagosians to vulnerable people in some communities and the disbursement of exercise books to primary schools in rural communities. This is in tandem with the ‘Turn It Around’ theme of the Global Goals Week, which seeks to empower people and communities to stem the negative tide of the pandemic as the deadline for the achievement of the global goals draws nearer.

In support of the Lagos SDGs Week and SDG 2 – Zero Hunger, the Old English Bakery will open all its outlets across Lagos State, where thousands of free loaves of bread will be given to Lagosians.

Amongst the reputable organisations and individuals supporting the inaugural Lagos SDGs Week are Procter & Gamble, Post Assurance Brokers, accomplished entrepreneur and global SDGs advocate, Mr. Tonye Cole; CEO, Post Assurance Brokers, Mr. Lekan Ajisafe; Human Resources expert, Ms. Mary Dinah and businessman, Akogun Lanre Alfred.","The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

243,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-economic-social-impacts-of-covid-19/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UNCTAD Report Details Economic, Social Impacts of COVID-19","A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretariat finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to “reverse much of the economic and social progress already made” towards SDG achievement. However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariat reports that it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.

In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’s Montreal Protocol has facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.

The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, which came into force in January 2019. It calls for reducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

In her message on the International Day, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that if fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment will prevent 0.4°C of global warming.

246,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-mulan,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Mulan’,"Replacing songs, bickering ancestral spirits and a tiny dragon sidekick with a shapeshifting witch and high-flying martial arts, this live-action remake doesn’t quite rise to the heights of Disney’s best remakes, but still manages to stand on its own.

At this point it seems pretty clear that the kiss of death, creatively speaking, for Disney’s new line of live-action/CGI remakes is a Broadway musical.

Until now, the better Disney remakes have been inspired reworkings of older films (Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Pete’s Dragon) that improved on their predecessors. The beloved cartoons of the Disney Renaissance (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin), on the other hand, have been adapted with stifling “fidelity,” serving only to highlight the superiority of the hand-animated originals. (Tim Burton’s Dumbo makes the point that loose adaptations of non-Renaissance cartoons can also be uninspired.)

Disney’s 1998 Mulan, loosely inspired by Chinese folklore about a woman named Hua Mulan who disguises herself as a man to take her father’s place in battle, is a Renaissance cartoon — but the remake, from director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) and several writers, including husband-wife reboot specialists Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes; Jurassic World; Avatar 2), doesn’t treat the cartoon as a sacred text.

Instead, following in the footsteps of Cinderella and The Jungle Book, the new Mulan weaves elements of the cartoon with new threads drawn from older sources (in this case The Ballad of Mulan and the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties) as well as new material invented for the film.

For example, Mulan’s ancestors are still reverentially invoked, along with the family’s “ancestral guardian,” here represented by a stone phoenix rather than a stone dragon. But the ancestors no longer appear as bickering luminous spirits or in any other form, and Eddie Murphy’s wisecracking dragon sidekick has been replaced with a silent, kite-like phoenix that may or may not exist in Mulan’s imagination.

The new Mulan isn’t even a musical — a liberty that would be unthinkable if the brand extended to Broadway. Instead, it’s a visually lavish, wuxia-influenced martial-arts action movie with warriors running on sheer walls or flying through the air to kick spears or arrows in midflight toward new targets with superhuman precision.

The result, while it doesn’t necessarily improve on its animated predecessor, isn’t overshadowed by it either and finds its own reason for existing.

Most notably, the redoubtable Gong Li plays a shapeshifting witch named Xianniang who serves the leader of the Rouran Khanate invading force led by fearsome Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee).

In the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties, Xianniang was a warrior daughter of the enemy king who bonded with Mulan after learning that Mulan, too, was a woman in a man’s world. Li’s Xianniang likewise feels a connection to Mulan (Liu Yifei), even if the feeling isn’t mutual.

Hated and feared even by her allies because of her magical powers, Xianniang serves the Khan in the hope of a future in which she might be accepted.

Mulan isn’t a witch, though she may be at risk of being branded one. From her youth she has had a natural gift for wielding chi — life force or energy — and her doting father, Zhou (Tzi Ma), a disabled veteran, couldn’t resist training his little girl as he would a son.

As she grows, though, Mulan’s exuberant antics — highlighted in a fun opening set piece involving a chicken — are increasingly socially unacceptable.

A daughter, we’re told over and over (a lot of things are repeated over and over), brings honor to her family by making a good marriage; Mulan must hide her gifts and learn to comport herself as a traditional Chinese bride.

This is potentially the stuff of “Squelched Girl Syndrome,” and, while Mulan is too spirited to be fully squelched, she does internalize the pressure to hide her gifts a bit too well.

Even passing as a man in Imperial Army boot camp, she berates herself after being provoked into revealing her abilities during a sparring match with a handsome recruit named Chen Honghui (Yoson An). (Donnie Yen plays the commanding officer who takes an interest in Mulan’s prowess. In contrast to the cartoon, Mulan’s romantic feelings are for her fellow recruit rather than her commander, reflecting post-Me Too concerns about romantic or sexual interest between leaders and subordinates.)

Xianniang, of course, sees through Mulan’s pretense — and, strikingly, sees her deception as a kind of compromising weakness, one with consequences. One of the themes in this telling is that Mulan fails to live up to the third of three virtues engraved on her father’s sword: “Loyal,” “Brave” and “True.” The cartoon Mulan’s true identity is accidentally revealed following an injury; the live-action film takes a different path.

Crucially, Caro directs combat sequences with flair; standout sequences include a face-off between Mulan’s company and Rouran fighters in a narrow corridor in the Imperial City, the capture of the Emperor (who mounts a terrific resistance, as you’d expect from Jet Li, but is overcome in a clever way) and the final showdown between Mulan and Bori Khan.

At times the wuxia elements seem inconsistently deployed. Long after it’s established that Mulan can run on walls and fly through the air, she has to clamber laboriously over rooftops — but only sometimes — at a moment when speed is of the essence. And while I liked that corridor fight in the Imperial City, shouldn’t Rouran fighters who can wield chi well enough to run on walls be more than a match for a similar number of Imperial troops who can’t?

I enjoyed Mulan, but I couldn’t avoid the sense of disconnect inherent in watching a wuxia-style period piece with Chinese actors speaking accented English dialogue. I imagine the disconnect will be sharper for Asian viewers for whom the essential Americanness of the production, and the shallowness of the Chinese cultural setting, will be more glaringly evident.

Article content GLEN WALTER — Some are predicting a very harsh winter, so it’s a good idea to have a reliable snow removal service lined up. That could be problematic, however. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Cornwall-SDG snow removal companies say they're struggling to survive Back to video Several local residential snow removal operators are sounding the alarm the industry is in a struggle – with its very survival at stake. “We’re fighting for our future,” said Frank Aroz, who operates Cornwall Snow Removal along with his wife Brenda, who technically is the owner, and son Matthew. The retired couple started operating the company back in 2014, a seasonal family business, with a list of drivers to call upon, a three-tractor operation. But times have gotten a lot tougher in recent years due to rising liability insurance costs, costs that seemed poised to rocket higher, and could launch the Arozs and other operators across the province right out of the industry. “Our fight is with the insurance companies, we need them to stop this nonsense,” Frank Aroz said. “We want fair premiums for fair coverage. . . right now we’re in line to provide the services (this upcoming winter), but it’s an urgent situation.”

Article content Another local operator, who wished to not have his name used in this article, said he believes it’s a strong assumption a lot of the mom-and-pop snow removal businesses may not be able to continue operating – even this year. He said it’s not known if some of them will be able to afford the premiums. The Arozs say they recently received a letter from their insurance company that, as of mid-October, their coverage would end, and that they suspect it’s due to potential liability claims. That’s had Brenda contacting “many, many brokers,” looking to get coverage, and without luck so far. Frank said he’s confident Cornwall Snow Removal will be able to, ultimately, get coverage, and provide services, but he knows it’ll come at a hefty price. “Our premiums will be going up – they’ll quadruple this year,” he said. “(But) we’ll do our damnedest to provide (services) to our clients, we have a rapport with them.” The Arozs said last year their premium was $345 a month, and with a huge increase expected, the best hope this season might be to merely break even. “We will survive this season, but who knows after that?” Frank said. The issue of skyrocketing costs in the snow removal industry came up early last February – before the pandemic – when the need to reduce layers of bureaucracy and red tape was a prevalent theme at MPP Jim McDonell’s pre-budget consultation meetings in Cornwall. Small business owner Mike Dominick, of Bainsville, was among the speakers at the table the owner/operator of Husky Services Snow Removal telling McDonell he and many other small business owners were continuing to struggle with rapidly rising liability insurance costs.

Article content “(Snow-removal businesses) cannot support insurance rate increases of 400 per cent in two years,” Dominick said, telling McDonell it was his fervent hope Bill 118 would be “expedited to pass before summer break” of the Ontario Legislative Assembly. Bill 118 is seen as possible relief for snow removal operations, as it would amend the Occupier’s Liability Act and help relieve some of the risk of slip and fall claims caused by snow and ice. The bill, which passed second reading in June of 2019, would decrease to 10 days the amount of time one can decide to start a law suit; individuals have been able to sue for personal injuries up to two years after an injury. One local snow removal operator told the Standard-Freeholder on Thursday that slip-and-fall lawsuits in the last year became a big problem, leading to out-of-control liability costs. He said snow removal companies working at commercial jobs are susceptible, but claims against companies plowing or blowing snow from residential driveways are almost unheard of. In six years with their insurance company, the Arozs said they have had no claims. But, the operators agree that the costs for commercial property claims are getting passed on to the little guys, to those providing residential services. And some might not survive because of it, even though it’s arguably a very essential service – just ask a senior citizen who needs the driveway cleared to get out to a medical appointment. “A lot of our clients are senior citizens,” Frank Aroz said. “If we don’t plow the driveway, guess what, they can’t get to the appointment.’’ And what could make matters worse this year, the Arozs say, is that so many seniors normally down south in the winter won’t be going anywhere. “Our main concern is our clients,” Brenda said. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

Farm Hop in SDG and P-R draws dozens, spotlights organic growing Back to video “It’s about (showcasing) organic farming, but also, we’re just proud of being here, and we’re happy to have people visiting our farm,” said Eleanor McGrath, owner of Springfield Farm along with her husband Finbarr McCarthy. The event was held at six locations had a goal of raising awareness of local food suppliers. It was a free, self-guided tour, taking place during what is National Organic Week, and officially organized by Canadian Organic Growers, which offers a program designed to provide extension support for farmers wanting to transition to organic. But give McGrath, and the Standard-Freeholder, assists in getting a local Farm Hop off the ground.

It was back in 2014 when McGrath, a documentary filmmaker, and McCarthy, an engineer – the couple has four children – purchased the over 200-year-old, 118-acre farm, and began splitting their time between what is life in the Toronto rat race and the solitude of Glengarry, working to establish Springfield in the growing agri-tourism/local food economy. There were organically-grown vegetables for sale at Springfield, walking tours, a variety of other activities – and lots of interest in a work-in-progress café. McCarthy talked about the “field-to-table” experience and Springfield’s experimenting in different crops over the years. “Some have been very successful,” McCarthy said. “This year garlic was very successful here.” The Farm Hop event ran in two, two-hour blocks, late on Saturday morning and from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.

Freezer beef and freezer chicken is sold at Jamink Farm, which has been organic since 2002, and owned by Thomas Booijink since 2013 when he bought it from his parents. “(Farm Hop is) all about reconnecting with your farmer and (learning more about) where your food comes from,” Julia said. “(Organic farming is) all about the quality of the food and leaving the land better for the next generation.” It’s a passion for the Booijinks and, in Julia’s case, goes back to her growing up on a dairy farm in Almonte. And after graduating from University of Guelph, and when Julia was living in the Woodstock area, she was milking cows in a rented barn there. Fifty cows were eventually moved from Woodstock to Jamink Farm, which had to get certified again as organic, and in 2013 it started shipping organic milk once again. Other Farm Hop participants included Alexandria’s Dream Small Farm, as well as at sites in Dalkeith, St-Eugene and St-Pascal-Baylon.

252,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/global-farm-trade-talks-restart-amid-slow-sdg-2-progress-covid-19-fears/,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: Global Farm Trade Talks Restart Amid Slow SDG 2 Progress, COVID-19 Fears","Negotiations on agriculture at the World Trade Organization (WTO) have restarted under the guidance of a new chair, Costa Rica’s Ambassador Gloria Abraham-Peralta, amid growing fears that the COVID-19 crisis and economic slowdown will hamper progress on the food security aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In 2015, world leaders committed to “correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets” as part of SDG 2, the Sustainable Development Goal covering hunger, nutrition, food security, and sustainable agriculture. However, conflict, climate change, and persistent poverty and inequality have stymied progress since then, with rising numbers of hungry people among other troubling trends.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, new farm subsidy packages and food export restrictions have sparked concern among other WTO members, who fear their own producers and consumers may be harmed. Many trade officials regret that countries applying these measures have not shared information about them transparently, Abraham-Peralta said in remarks to a negotiating session she convened on 25 September.

The chair told delegates that farm subsidy reform – covered by WTO talks on “agricultural domestic support” – remains top of the agenda for most of the trade body’s members ahead of the Organization’s Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12). After the pandemic prompted Kazakhstan to postpone plans to hold the high-level event this summer, it is now tentatively slated for June 2021 instead.

“Domestic Support remains the priority for many delegations, even more so in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and the SDG goals,” Abraham-Peralta said in her report to delegates.

Farm Trade Outcome “A Must”

The chair also said it was essential that WTO members strike a deal on agriculture when ministers next meet.

“It is clear for all that an agricultural outcome at MC12 is a must to preserve the credibility of the organization in the years ahead,” her report to the meeting said.

In recent years, members have struggled to make progress in negotiations on the controversial area, despite striking a deal to end agricultural export subsidies at the WTO’s Nairobi ministerial conference in 2015 – an explicit component of SDG target 2b – and two years earlier agreeing a declaration on public food stockholding programmes and WTO farm subsidy rules when they met in Bali, Indonesia.

Trade ministers failed to reach any consensus agreement on agriculture when they met in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2017 – leaving the trade body with no clear roadmap on how talks should proceed.

The WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture mandates the continuation of negotiations in its Article 20 – but markets for food and farm goods have nonetheless changed immensely in the quarter century that has elapsed since the treaty entered into force.

Seven Negotiating Areas

Abraham-Peralta reported back on her consultations with delegations in the seven ongoing negotiating areas.

Three of these relate to areas on which rules exist already under the Agreement on Agriculture. These are: domestic support to agriculture, where agricultural exporting countries and most developing countries seek new commitments; market access, covering tariffs on farm goods and other similar border restrictions, where again exporters seek concessions from importing countries; and export competition, covering agricultural export subsidies and other measures seen as similar.

Four other topics are more recent. These include the question of trade in cotton, of particular concern to West African countries; food export restrictions, where importing countries in particular have raised concerns; public food stockholding, where certain developing countries favour greater flexibility under WTO farm subsidy rules; and the question of a new “special safeguard mechanism,” which developing countries would be able to use to raise tariffs temporarily in the event of a sudden import surge or price depression.

The chair told the meeting that she “did not detect any major shift” in countries’ negotiating positions, which she said had been captured well in the final report issued by her predecessor, Guyanan ambassador J.R. “Deep” Ford.

A Changing Trade Landscape

Rapid change in food and agricultural markets have upended efforts to rewrite the global rulebook on farm trade. In particular, the rise of China, India, and other “emerging” developing countries have led to rapid growth in South-South trade – and changed how key players see the talks. Many countries have also fast-tracked efforts to strike bilateral and regional trade deals – depriving WTO talks of the political impetus they need to move ahead.

However, some long-standing farm trade concerns can only be resolved through broad-based collective action, with the question of farm subsidy reform chief among them. The WTO’s Deputy Directory-General Alan Wolff recently underscored this point: “To date, there has not been a single regional or bilateral trade agreement that has tackled the issue of agricultural subsidies.”

The Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries have long been proponents of reform in this area – with the group including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, plus a dozen other members. The EU – whose subsidies were for decades a prime target of exporters– has taken successive steps to reform the support it provides, “decoupling” it from prices and production and seeking to shift payments towards rewarding producers for delivering environmental benefits. In contrast, the US continues to provide substantial levels of support linked directly to farm output, with recent subsidy packages aimed at compensating producers for the impact of the Trump Administration’s trade war with China, and more recently COVID-19-related disruption. Meanwhile, China and India have emerged as significant providers of agricultural support, prompting concerns from trading partners in both the developed and developing world who fear their own producers could be unfairly disadvantaged. The four WTO members together account for some three-quarters of all support classed as trade-distorting under the trade body’s current rules.

High tariffs on farm goods – especially “sensitive” products such as beef, dairy products or rice – remain another sore point in the talks. With Japan, Switzerland, and the EU among WTO members maintaining high levels of protection, exporting countries such as Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay would like to see trade barriers reduced and simplified in the talks.

Following the 2015 Nairobi deal to end agricultural export subsidies, WTO members such as the US are reluctant to pursue further talks in this area. However, some Cairns Group countries would like to see more done in areas where they consider more progress is needed – in particular on topics like export credits, food aid, and agricultural exporting state trade enterprises.

Meanwhile, India has spearheaded a push by the G-33 developing country coalition to ease WTO rules that require food purchased at government-set prices to count towards the trade body’s maximum permitted farm subsidy limits, when these purchases are part of public stockholding programmes for food security purposes. Proponents want a “permanent solution” to the issue, following a 2014 decision on the topic by the WTO’s General Council. Exporting countries, and some other developing countries, nonetheless fear that subsidised food purchases could undermine producer livelihoods and food security abroad if stocks end up being exported abroad. G-33 members include China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as well as over three dozen other countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.

The G-33 is also behind efforts to agree a new “special safeguard mechanism” to help developing countries shield producers from sudden import surges and price depressions. While exporting countries have agreed in principle to the talks in this area, they have nonetheless linked progress on the topic to efforts to improve market access for farm goods. The ensuing deadlock has meant WTO members’ negotiating positions remain far apart on this question.

One area where food importing countries such as Japan and Switzerland would like to see action is the issue of food export restrictions – a topic which has hit the headlines in recent months due to COVID-19. Numerous WTO members, fearing shortages, initially imposed bans or other limits on exports – although, with ample food stocks and robust farm output, many of these measures have since been lifted. Poor consumers in low-income food-importing countries are particularly vulnerable if export restrictions in major exporting countries cause world food prices to rise. WTO members are currently discussing options to improve transparency, and potentially also to exempt UN humanitarian food aid purchases from these measures.

Finally, cotton-producing countries in West Africa have long called for reform of farm subsidies that harm their producers by pushing down prices on world markets. While US cotton support schemes have been a particular focus of the talks in this area, Washington has argued that subsidies provided by China must also be part of any eventual deal.

Small Steps Forward?

Abraham-Peralta’s report to the meeting notes that some delegations see three successive time horizons for the talks: short term work; deliverables for MC12; and a post-MC12 work programme.

In the short term, the chair will appoint facilitators on specific negotiating topics to help her with her work. She also indicated she would convene small-group discussions in addition to meetings open to all members, while remaining committed to inclusiveness and transparency.

Negotiating meetings open to the full membership are now planned for 10 November and 7 December. Members would be able to re-evaluate the process she is leading by the year-end or in early 2021.

The researchers divide the suggested interventions into three focus areas:

On the farm—including training for farmers, developing climate-resilient crops, and improving livestock feed (USD 9 billion);

Food on the move—ensuring food can get from the farm to market, through investments in storage, transport, and other infrastructure (USD 2 billion); and

Empower the excluded— measures to ensure the poorest are included, such as steps regarding social protection spending or training for rural youth (USD 3 billion).

This Ceres2030 project was led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The researchers used two interlinked research approaches to develop their findings. The first involved the development of a machine-learning tool to analyze over 500,000 published reports and articles. This tool helped the team of 78 researchers from 23 countries to summarize the evidence from over 20 years of agricultural development literature. The second part of the research involved economic modelling. The researchers created a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how much it would cost to end hunger, increase incomes and protect the climate by 2030.

The proposed additional USD 14 billion per year until 2030 would represent a doubling in the amount of aid currently given for food security and nutrition each year. The researchers note that it must be accompanied by an additional USD 19 billion a year from low- and middle-income countries’ own budgets.

The research findings support an integrated approach, recognizing that “agricultural interventions are more effective with a population that enjoys at least a minimum level of income, education, with access to networks and resources such as extension services and robust infrastructure.” The research also revealed that it is more effective to create integrated portfolios of interventions rather than to support improvements in isolation from one another.

Regarding women’s empowerment, the researchers indicate that the evidence base is sparse, due to the fact that only 10% of the papers reviewed considered gender differences in the outcomes of the interventions.

The researchers organize their 10 key recommendations for donor governments based on the three focus areas for interventions, as follows.

Empower the excluded:

Support participation in farmers’ organizations

Invest in vocational programs for rural youth that offer integrated-training in multiple skills

Scale up social protection programs to help create a bridge for people living in poverty to find productive jobs

On the Farm:

Invest in information and training, particularly for women, to increase the uptake of new technologies

Ensure new environmentally-friendly farming methods are also economically viable

Support the adoption of climate-resilient crops

Increase research on how to help small-scale producers in water-scarce regions

Target improvements in the quantity and quality of livestock feed to small and medium-sized commercial farms

Food on the Move:

To reduce post-harvest losses, look beyond the storage of cereals to also focus on other food groups and other parts of the food value chain

Invest in the infrastructure, regulations, services and technical assistance needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that supply or buy from small-scale farmers

The findings from the review of literature were published by Nature Research in a new research collection of peer-reviewed journal articles.

The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

The SDG Trade Monitor was launched at WTO headquarters on World Statistics Day on 20 October.

The portal aims to improve users’ understanding of the relationship between trade and sustainable development by enabling customized analysis of the trade-related SDG indicators and highlighting the latest progress in achieving the relevant SDG targets.

Speaking at the launch event, WTO Deputy Director-General Yonov Frederick Agah emphasized the role of trade as “an engine for economic growth” that “has unlocked massive poverty reduction gains and socio-economic development across the globe, particularly in developing countries.” He said the multi-agency collaboration proves that “multilateral efforts in trade are possible and worthwhile.”

UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant described the SDG Trade Monitor as a “one-stop-shop” where users can “obtain the most updated, official figures of trade-related SDG indicators.”

ITC Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton identified trade as “one of the most crucial means of implementing the SDGs.”

The SDG Trade Monitor gathers data on:

SDG target 2.b, on correcting and preventing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets;

SDG target 8.a, on increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries (LDCs);

SDG target 10.a, on implementing the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries and LDCs;

SDG target 17.10, on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system (MTS);

SDG target 17.11, on increasing the exports of developing countries and LDCs; and

SDG target 17.12, on implementing long-term, duty-free, and quota-free market access for all LDCs.

During the last three weeks, the following countries have indicated their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR):

Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, Nicaragua, and San Marino, for their first VNRs;

Cabo Verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Japan, Namibia, and Tunisia, for their second VNRs; and

Colombia, for its third VNR.

The following 30 countries had already expressed an interest as of 30 September 2020:

First-time presenters: Angola, Bolivia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, and Myanmar;

Second-time presenters: Bahamas, Bhutan, Chad, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Zimbabwe; and

Third-time presenters: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has indicated that no more than 42 countries will be able to present VNRs during HLPF 2021, due to time constraints.

An informal “group of friends” made up of UN Member States, established in 2019, will support the countries presenting VNRs in 2021. The group is coordinated by the delegation of Mexico to the UN.

The 2021 session of the HLPF will convene from 6-15 July under the auspices of ECOSOC. It will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ HLPF 2021 will review nine SDGs in depth:

Goal 1 (No poverty);

Goal 2 (Zero hunger);

Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing);

Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth);

Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities);

Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production);

Goal 13 (Climate action);

Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and

Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

One outcome of the HLPF is expected to be a ministerial declaration adopted at the end of the ministerial segment. At the 2020 HLPF, governments did not reach agreement on the ministerial declaration. UN Member States had attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration leading up to the HLPF, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were unable to finalize negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that if the meeting had taken place in person, governments could have voted on the draft, but “in the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was reached.

In September 2020, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, but the Council did not adopt it. ECOSOC President Munir Akram indicated that he would to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

Akram has explained that notwithstanding the lack of agreement on a Ministerial Declaration, in the HLPF discussions, Member States:

Expressed their firm commitment to a multilateral response to COVID-19;

Stressed that vulnerable countries must not be left behind in the recovery;

Called for adequate financing, debt relief and debt waivers to be provided, particularly for low- and middle-income countries; and

Acknowledged that once developed, a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone and everywhere, rich or poor, at affordable prices.

He said governments expressed that the means of implementation for the SDGs must be strengthened to meet both the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda, and the need for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited, in particular, financing, sustainable infrastructure and investment, international trade, science and technology, capacity building and partnerships.

257,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/boosting-education-for-greener-forests/,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Boosting Education for Greener Forests,"With every new forest fire or flood, and with every new report on the loss of wildlife or increase in desertification, we are reminded that we urgently need greater attention and efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the world’s forests. Fewer natural disasters, a more stable climate, healthier people, and stronger economies are just some of the benefits that we stand to gain from helping forests to thrive.

But do we know enough about the world’s forests to take care of them properly?

There is growing international concern over the quality and availability of training and education needed both to prepare those whose daily work and decisions most closely impact the sustainable management of forests, and to inform new generations who will look after forest resources in the future.

We can only guess at how many children these days dream of being a forester when they grow up – likely too few. For the sake of our forests, we have to turn this situation around.

We need talented students to enter forest education programmes. We need well-trained forest managers and policymakers. We need to provide more opportunities for informal training and continuing education for forest communities and forest owners and businesses. And we need to reach the broader public.

After all, there is important work to do.

Internationally agreed targets for improving lives and protecting the planet recognize the vital importance of forests, which provide livelihoods for over a billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures.

SDG 15, for one, aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Other SDGs, such as those concerned with clean water (SDG 6) and the elimination of hunger and poverty (SDGs 2 and 1), depend to a great extent on the sustainable management of forests and urban green spaces.

To ensure that forests fulfil their potential in helping to achieve many development goals, including SDG 13 (climate action), we need to enrich forest education and inspire a new generation of forest managers. This is no easy task.

Heads of forestry from across the world are meeting online for the 25th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Committee on Forestry and 7th World Forest Week. Here, FAO and international partners are unveiling details of an assessment of forest education being conducted across six regions.

The first of its kind, the survey will gather comprehensive information on where, how, and how well forest education is being taught, from primary and secondary schools to technical and vocational institutions and universities.

The survey (open for responses until 31 October) is part of an ambitious project led by FAO, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO). The project, funded by the German government, aims to enhance forest education at national and local levels, and to address the considerable deficiencies in forest education in many parts of the world.

There are several ways we can try to achieve this. Providing easy access to information on forest education and to learning materials, including through web-based platforms, will expand the opportunities of forest-related learning to a far wider audience.

And instilling young children with an appreciation of forests, the many benefits they bring, and the need to manage them sustainably is also key to inspiring the next generation of foresters.

For this last reason, Germany is also supporting an FAO project to bring targeted forest education to schoolchildren aged 9-12, starting with a pilot lesson series tailored for Tanzania and the Philippines. The interactive lessons are designed to help children understand how forests help combat climate change and contribute to food security, lives, and livelihoods.

Forests are the most biologically diverse ecosystems on land, home to the majority of terrestrial species of animals and plants. If forest education remains insufficient, outdated, and deteriorating in many places, we will struggle to keep pace with changing societal demands on forests and increasing pressures on forest resources.

We need to improve forest education – and more widely, public understanding of forests and forestry – to help to prepare current and future generations to do a better job of protecting land and water resources, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

The study provides 21 recommendations on amplifying the “substantially muted voices of women” in COVID-19 news coverage.

The study titled, ‘The Missing Perspectives of Women in COVID-19 News: A special report on women’s under-representation in news media,’ released in September 2020, focuses on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, UK, and US. It draws on a computational news content analysis of 11,913 publications and 1.9 million stories between 1 March and 15 April 2020, as well as a mix of other quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

The study finds that in the six countries analyzed, women are effectively political invisible in COVID-19-related decision-making processes. Moreover, in times of crisis, journalists may revert back to “established sources” who are significantly more likely to be men. The study finds that every individual woman’s voice in the news on COVID-19 is “drowned out by the voices of at least three, four, or five men.”

The findings reveal not just how many women are represented in COVID-19 news, but also how they are portrayed in the story. The author explains that the women who are given a platform in the COVID-19 story are “rarely portrayed as authoritative experts or as empowered individuals but more frequently as sources of personal opinion or as victims/people affected by the disease.” Women constituted 19% of experts while men constituted 77% in the 175 most highly ranked COVID-19 articles across the six countries.

In addition, few women feature as “protagonists” in COVID-19 news coverage, even less so than in news not related to COVID-19. The absence of women’s perspectives in COVID-19 news means that women have limited influence over the framing of the crisis. This results in limited influence over policymaking directions, and thus further marginalization within societies.

Recommendations to redress the bias include steps to focus on women as sources of expertise and protagonists, cover gender equality, consider the implications of the framing of stories, and seek to understand the implications of reporting on women’s lives.

The study is authored by Luba Kassova, international audience strategy consultancy AKAS Ltd. This report is the precursor to an expanded publication on the entire news value chain, commissioned in support of UN Women’s Generation Equality Forum. The expanded study will offer a gender parity checklist for news providers around the world.

The high-level event convened in the margins of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 30 September, in a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government and ministers joining virtually. The Summit focused on the theme, ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development.’

The opening segment included a “fireside chat” between the heads of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). They described biodiversity as a “shock absorber,” and said the time to “pollute our way to wealth” has passed.

Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said degradation of nature spans economics, social justice, and human rights, and can result in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Many expressed concern that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Speakers warned that biodiversity loss threatens food security, water supplies, and livelihoods, as well as our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events.

Munir Akram, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), said political will, not finance, is key to contain “economic greed” and “policy negligence.” UNGA President Volkan Bozkir called on Member States to use the Summit to build political momentum towards a post‑2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Kunming, China in 2021. “Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change,” said Bozkir, by placing the biodiversity discourse firmly on the political agenda.

A plenary session followed, during which participants highlighted the connections between biodiversity, societies, and economies.

The report aims to help countries align their development pathways with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies that promote climate resilience of food and water systems, energy, transport, and cities, among other sectors.

The report titled, ‘World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization,’ highlights the “huge risks” climate change poses to countries’ long-term development and growth, with critical implications for poverty, food security, and health. In a foreword, Juergen Voegele, World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, cautions that all countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, are now facing “the compound impacts of the twin challenges” of climate change and COVID-19.

The report notes that the ambition reflected in the first round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) would only limit global warming to 2.7-3.7°C above preindustrial levels. It warns that a continued focus on short- and medium-term targets could make decarbonization more difficult, and calls for long-term strategies to help countries develop sustainably. “By planning ahead, these strategies can boost new economic activity and innovations, creating the jobs of the future, while also securing a safer climate, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable,” said Mari Pangestu, World Bank’s Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, at the report’s launch.

The Outlook 2050 recognizes the need for a “bold economic transformation” to realize the vision of the Paris Agreement and make the SDGs “more achievable,” which includes aligning finance flows with low-emissions, climate-resilient development pathways. It proposes a “whole-of-economy” approach to decarbonization, which prioritizes four economy-wide strategic directions:

Embed long-term climate priorities in countries’ macroeconomic frameworks;

Embed long-term climate planning in national budgets and expenditure frameworks;

Embed long-term climate objectives in financial sector regulations and incentives; and

Embed long-term climate objectives in systems planning.

The report identifies cross-sectoral opportunities and makes recommendations across eight areas that are essential for achieving the SDGs: 1) transforming food systems; 2) protecting land-based ecosystems and carbon sinks; 3) transforming energy systems; 4) transforming mobility; 5) building low-carbon, more resilient urban areas; 6) transforming water systems; 7) transforming the ocean economy; and 8) digital transformation. The Outlook 2050 finds that investing in cross-sectoral opportunities, including as part of stimulus packages, can aid in a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report was launched on 24 June, during the ‘Kickstarting the Sustainable Recovery’ event series, organized by the World Bank’s Climate Change Group in partnership with Innovate4Climate. The series focused on the role of sustainable finance in the COVID-19 recovery to help countries “build back better and stronger.” [Publication: World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization] [Publication Landing Page] [World Bank Press Release]","The World Bank has published a report that outlines economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic.

This year’s work will include negotiating the 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of the UN’s operational activities for development (QCPR).

On 5 October 2020, the Committee, chaired by the Permanent Representative of Nepal, held an in-person session to adopt its programme of work for the year. The Committee also began its general debate on the theme of ‘Building back better after COVID-19: Ensuring a more equitable global economy, inclusive societies and sustainable recovery.’

We must take full advantage of the improvements we have made to the UN development system, to help countries recover better from COVID-19.

The Chair said the Committee will focus on issues affecting groups of countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). He also highlighted:

the Food Systems Summit being planned for 2021,

the Committee will discuss the modalities for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028, through a high-level event convening from 22-24 March 2023, in New York, and

it is time to conduct the QCPR, which takes place every four years and was last conducted in 2016.

In a keynote address to the Second Committee, Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, said the international community cannot squeeze water from a stone: developing economies and emerging markets cannot find financial resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic without significant debt restructuring. He expressed support for the issuance of special drawing rights.

Stiglitz also called for multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes, such as by creating a minimum global corporate income tax at the level of 2%. He added that greening economies can be timely, targeted, labor-intensive, and provide good stimulus.

Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said COVID-19 stimulus packages will be most effective if they prioritize public investments that contribute to achieving the SDGs, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and digital infrastructure.

Member States speaking during the debate emphasized the need for stronger international cooperation to face the “seemingly endless cycles” of COVID-19, especially in States that lack recovery financing. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged “vaccine multilateralism” to ensure equitable, universal, and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Another delegate suggested considering vaccines and therapeutic treatments as global public goods.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) noted some government’s “retreat” from the development agenda and climate change commitments. She also noted the inability of SIDS to access available climate finance because of “cumbersome processes and competition with other better capacitated countries.”

Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) said “there should be no rollback of existing commitments,” and it is vital to promote full participation of people with disabilities, women and children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. He supported new approaches to addressing the debt crisis and maintain jobs, particularly in the LDCs. The general debate continues until 9 October 2020 in a virtual format.

Also during the Second Committee’s in-person meeting on 5 October, UN Deputy Secretary‑General Amina Mohammed’s provided a briefing on the 2020 QCPR, noting that it takes place at the outset of the Decade of Action for sustainable development.

Recalling that the previous QCPR in 2016 “paved the way for the deepest transformation in the history” of the UN development system, Mohammed reported that the UN has since established a new coordination system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda, including a funding compact with Member States. In May 2020, during the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, she said governments decided to move forward on other mandates set out in the 2016 QCPR, including to operationalize a new regional architecture, strengthen support to multi‑country offices (MCOs), and bolster independent system‑wide evaluations for accountability.

Mohammed said that now, to help countries recover better from COVID-19, “we must take full advantage of the improvements we have made” to the UN development system. She called on Member States to give strategic direction to this process through the 2020 QCPR, particularly in the following ways:

Additional resources are needed in priority policy areas, including climate change, economic transformation and employment, women’s empowerment, and digitalization;

At the country level, the UN is introducing integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs, and the QCPR can provide clarity on expectations;

Coherence between the UN’s pillars;

On leaving no one behind, the QCPR “can give visibility to those excluded and on the margins,” including persons with disabilities and women and girls. She said the process can also clarify Member States’ expectations for a recovery from COVID‑19 that is anchored in inclusive and green economies, and noted that greater investment is needed in data for evidence‑based decision‑making; and

Completing the “unfinished business” of the 2016 QCPR, such as meeting the targets of the funding compact.

In addition to deliberations on its official agenda items, the Committee will hold three other events. A joint meeting with ECOSOC will address ‘Developing sustainable infrastructure and utilizing science and technology in response to COVID-19,’ on 14 October. A virtual side event on ‘Disaster risk-informed and resilient COVID-19 recovery’ will take place on 15 October. An annual dialogue with the executive secretaries of the UN regional commissions is scheduled for 19 October.

Action on draft resolutions is expected to take place in November.

This is especially true for the world’s forests.

Forests have a key role to play in helping to achieve many of the SDGs, from mitigating climate change by acting carbon sinks to providing food, livelihoods, fuel, shelter, and clean water.

However, the forest sector has an image problem.

In many places around the world, forests are seen as something to be set aside for conservation. Many communication campaigns around forests contain sweeping shots showing forests as great swathes of green – exactly what the public does not want to see cut down. The buzz of a chainsaw in this context would make many people recoil.

But to say that there is a vital difference between sustainably managing forests and indiscriminate logging would be an understatement.

The challenge is to communicate this to the general public and to change this deep-seated way of thinking about forests. We need to improve understanding of the sustainable use of forests for diverse purposes not only for the benefit of billions of people, including some of the world’s most vulnerable, but also as an elemental means of protecting forests themselves.

As the world focuses on building back better in the aftermath of COVID-19, this communication challenge is more pressing than ever. Forests – and forest products – can help tackle climate change and reach sustainability goals and should be included in recovery plans as we design a new normal.

The pandemic is also a moment in history when people are more conscious of how important forest products are in our daily lives. During the crisis, forest products have been at the forefront of providing hygiene products and other supplies for personal protective equipment, biomass for energy, and ethanol for cleaning, as well as packaging for food and parcels.

COVID-19 has also brought about a shift in consumer attitudes and behavior as people reassess their priorities. In a survey by consulting firm McKinsey, almost two-thirds of consumers surveyed have made significant changes to their lifestyle to reduce their environmental impact. More than 60% report starting to recycle and buying products in environmentally friendly packaging. A vast majority of respondents say more attention should be paid to reducing pollution – something wood products can achieve by replacing plastic alternatives.

We need to use this window of opportunity to turn perceptions of sustainable forestry and forest products around.

After all, there is a powerful “sustainable wood” story to tell, because science and innovation are pushing the boundaries of what we can do with wood products, from construction to medicine, as well as replacing fossil fuel-based products with products from renewable sources. We have a great opportunity to form a persuasive narrative about solutions, to rethink our development paths, to reduce our carbon footprint, and to work together on solving the economic, biodiversity, and climate change crises.

What can we do to ensure that we do not miss our chance to reframe the forest sector and sustainable forest products?

First, we need to ensure our messaging is consistent. Governments, international organizations, and the private sector need to work together to promote the understanding of topical forestry issues in order to strengthen sustainable forest management in policy and practice.

Second, we need to showcase the innovations that use wood as a valid, affordable, and renewable alternative to fossil-derived products.

Third, we need to transform and simplify a complex and abstract agenda into human stories. We need to make our message relevant to people’s everyday lives and what they can do personally to help build a better world.

Finally, we need to explain better the truth that so many people have yet to grasp: how and why sustainable wood products, rather than causing deforestation, actually contribute to keeping forests and ecosystems healthy, while helping to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. As the proverb holds, “fact is fact, but perception is reality.”

As people re-evaluate their lives as a result of direct and indirect implications of COVID-19, we have a rare opportunity to make forestry a meaningful part of the solution. Let us not waste it.

Panelists focused on ways to facilitate dialogue among researchers, policymakers, and communities to advance sustainability goals in the areas of food systems and land use, urbanization, and health.

The conference themed, ‘Science for a Sustainable Future,’ took place virtually on 8 October. Researchers came together with UN officials, government representatives, civil society leaders, experts, and policymakers to discuss how by working together we can “solve our most critical sustainable development challenges” and achieve the targets set out in the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Ahead of the conference, Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN President and Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, US, and Magdalena Skipper, Editor-in-Chief, Nature, issued a joint statement warning that our progress on the SDGs “lags far behind,” with the COVID-19 pandemic exposing the gaps between the latest scientific developments and policymaking. Highlighting “increasingly frequent zoonotic diseases,” climate change, biodiversity destruction, and “unprecedented” income and wealth inequalities among today’s challenges, the statement identifies the need to find a more inclusive path to solving problems that brings together scientists and technologists with policymakers and stakeholders, “listens across the generations,” and includes under-represented and marginalized voices.

Opening the event, Sachs said deep transformations are needed to address multiple global challenges to sustainable development and establish shared prosperity, social justice, environmental sustainability, and decent governance. He called for: technological pathways to sustainability that improve well-being and align with sustainable development; engaging natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and human sciences in an interdisciplinary manner; engaging multiple stakeholders, including science and engineering communities, policymakers, and civil society; and enabling a better informed public to be “carriers of the ethics of the common good,” informed by science.

Guido Schmidt-Traub, SDSN Executive Director moderated a panel discussion on food systems and land use.

Michael Obersteiner, University of Oxford, highlighted the need to “bend the curve” on biodiversity. He outlined the role of quantitative assessments in bringing together stakeholders and establishing trust among them. Obersteiner said bringing local implementation to the global level through knowledge networks and feedback loops is key to accelerating transitions.

Jessica Fanzo, Johns Hopkins University, described the Food Systems Dashboard that brings together data on 175 food systems indicators. She said researchers need to better communicate their findings to policymakers, with studies integrating multiple perspectives.

Jillian Campbell, CBD, highlighted the importance of building a monitoring framework for a post-2020 biodiversity framework. She stressed the need to do more to “convince the public.”

Ashish Kothari, Environmentalist and Founder of Kalpavriksh, India, emphasized the need to engage custodians of biodiversity in decision making and establish forums where hybrid knowledge systems can be built. He stressed the need for bottom-up approaches to biodiversity management and conservation.

During discussion, panelists outlined the role of data in supporting poor countries’ efforts in the land-use sector, the need for different systems of knowledge, and the need to protect biodiversity to prevent future “zoonotic spillovers.”

Mark Fischetti, Scientific American, moderated a session on urbanization. Panelists identified challenges to sustainable urbanization, provided examples of where science made a fundamental contribution, and highlighted lessons from the global South.

Chan Heng Chee, Ambassador-at-Large, Singapore, and Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at Singapore University of Technology and Design, highlighted Virtual Singapore – a three-dimensional (3D) city model tool that helps conduct virtual experiments such as planning for solar energy generation and safe cycling routes. She stressed the need to involve citizens in making cities “more livable and more lovable.”

Aromar Revi, Indian Institute for Human Settlements, identified the need to balance opportunities of urbanization against poverty and risk, and highlighted the potential of urbanization to accelerate post-COVID-19 recovery in India.

Susan Parnell, University of Bristol, urged focus on building institutions to deliver sustainable urbanization. She underscored the need to understand micro-processes and build a “cohort of people” committed to sustainable cities. Parnell warned against the “one science fits all” approach, decoupled from ethics and robust methods.

Luis Hernán Sáenz, Cómo Vamos Cities Network, Colombia, highlighted the Urban Footprint study and the Multidimensional Urban Poverty Index. He called for promoting more effective governance in line with SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) by including citizen science to leave no one behind and improve evidence-based decision making.

A panel session on health, moderated by Amy Maxmen, Nature, focused on the role of science and policy in achieving SDG health targets, and lessons learned from the COVID-19 response.

Chikwe Ihekweazu, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, called for mechanisms to push science to answer pressing questions rather than letting it “trickle down” into policymaking.

John Reeder, World Health Organization (WHO), urged researchers to provide tailored responses to the questions policymakers are asking, focusing on the specific context. He said scientists need to articulate priorities that are translatable into real public health impact.

Miriam Were, Champions for an AIDS-Free Generation, pointed to the lack of people’s perspectives in discussions on science and policymaking, and urged focus on community access to basic health services.

David Heymann, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, highlighted the importance of communicating scientific findings to those affected by their impacts.

Panelists further highlighted the need to: continue to inspire young people to choose science as a career path; and promote mentoring programs that pair researchers in industrialized and developing countries throughout the project cycle and beyond.

In closing, Skipper and Schmidt-Traub highlighted key takeaways, including the need for strong engagement with people and communities, the importance of data availability and access to improve strategies for bringing scientific communities and data users together, and the need to “cut across silos” in communicating scientific findings. Skipper said a white paper based on these outcomes will provide a set of recommendations on how to achieve better integration of science, policy, and community.

Once in force, the emission reduction commitments of participating developed countries and economies in transition (EITs) become legally binding.

The Doha Amendment’s entry into force, a UNFCCC press release notes, is “critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.” Its entry into force also means that “accounting of the Kyoto Protocol’s second phase can go ahead as anticipated and that the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance committee can fully fulfill its legal functions.”

Since our last update in July 2019, 15 countries have ratified the Doha Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 145. The Amendment will formally enter into force within 90 days from 1 October 2020, when the 144th instrument of acceptance was received by the Depositary.

The Amendment’s entry into force is critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.

Angola submitted its instrument of acceptance on 22 September 2020; Bolivia on 17 September 2020; Egypt on 3 February 2020; El Salvador on 18 September 2019; Georgia on 16 June 2020; Ghana on 24 September 2020; Guatemala on 15 October 2019; Jamaica on 1 October 2020; Jordan on 3 January 2020; Nigeria on 2 October 2020; Niue on 10 December 2019; North Macedonia on 18 October 2019; Senegal on 27 May 2020; Sierra Leone on 15 June 2020; and Zambia on 22 August 2019.

The Amendment sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 18% compared to 1990 levels for participating countries. This, according to the UNFCCC, “represents an increase from an average reduction of 5% compared to 1990 levels” during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period from 2008-2012.

“The Doha Amendment’s entry into force is a strong signal of a unified, multilateral commitment to address climate change,” said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. She noted that it represents political commitment to pre-2020 action, which, she said, is necessary to build trust ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.

The entry into force of the Doha Amendment occurs at a time when global emissions are likely to result in an increase of global average temperatures of 3°C above preindustrial levels, the UNFCCC warns. Therefore, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries are expected to submit in 2020 remain critical for reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep global warming “well below” 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.

The Global Education Forum convened virtually on 10 September 2020 in the lead-up to the 2020 Global Education Meeting (GEM), an extraordinary session that will convene from 20-22 October.

Forum participants discussed a white paper from the Save Our Future campaign, which provides a roadmap for education in COVID-19 recovery and across the Decade of Action for the SDGs. The paper builds on the UN Secretary-General’s August 2020 policy brief titled, ‘Education during COVID-19 and beyond.’ That Policy Brief:

States that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly 1.6 billion learners across all continents, and school closures have impacted 94% of the world’s student population and up to 99% of learners in low and lower-middle income countries;

Details the impacts to education and learning while stressing that the impacts go beyond education, affecting the provision of essential services to children and communities, access to nutritious food, the ability of many parents to work, and the potential risks of violence against women and girls; and

Makes concrete recommendations to prevent the “learning crisis from becoming a generational catastrophe,” including: suppressing transmission of the virus and planning for school re-openings; protecting education financing and coordinating for impact; building resilient education systems for equitable and sustainable development; and reimagining education and accelerating change in teaching and learning.

Addressing the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed urged making education a top priority in the pandemic response and recovery spending in international investments and national budgets. She emphasized the need to ensure that every dollar invested “leads to maximum possible impact, especially for our girls.”

A policy paper released by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2020 cites a USD148 billion annual financing gap in low- and lower-middle-income countries to achieve SDG 4 from now until 2030. COVID-19-related school closures could increase this financing gap by up to one-third, the paper reports.

From 20-22 October, an extraordinary session of the Global Education Meeting (2020 GEM) will convene on the topic, ‘Education post-COVID-19.’ The meeting is co-hosted by UNESCO and the UK. The session aims to be a platform for participants to “protect and rethink education in the current and post-COVID-19 world,” and set priorities for educational recovery and progress in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. The meeting is expected to result in the 2020 GEM Declaration. The Declaration will present an improved global education cooperation mechanism, for adoption at the next GEM in 2021.

The Strategy was launched in June 2019 in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

The Strategy aims to enable the UN system to support the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the SDGs, the Agenda for Humanity prepared for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy will be implemented for five years and then reviewed and updated as needed.

The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.

The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.

Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”

Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.

The UNGA’s Third Committee (social, humanitarian, and cultural issues) is considering a draft resolution on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/C.3/75/L.9).

Such information enables policymakers to identify the systemic loss of a country’s economic potential, and revise budgets to support prevention and protection. SDG target 5.2 calls to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.”



The report estimates that 500,000 working days are lost to marital violence annually, as women exposed to domestic violence are typically less productive and tend to take more time off, resulting in an economic loss for them and the economy as a whole. Sexual violence can result in unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages and reproductive health issues.

Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The tool features case studies from Egypt, the UK, Viet Nam and Palestine. In Egypt, the study finds that approximately 5.6 million women experience violence at the hands of their husband or fiancé annually, and the cost for women and families due to violence is approximately LE 2.17 billion. The study reports that disseminating the findings has led to increased recognition of the impact of violence against women on the entire economy and increased advocacy, resulting in:

an increase in the Ministry of Planning’s budget for violence against women-related activities;

an increase in the number of female police officers; and

development of a new draft law on violence against women that is under consideration by parliament.

The UK case study finds that the total cost of domestic violence to society is approximately £23 billion, of which £3.1 billion is borne by the state through support to the criminal justice system, health system, social services, social housing, and legal aid bills to support victims. Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The case study on Viet Nam highlights how the survey results have contributed to increased awareness of the impact of domestic violence and enhanced service provision. UN Women and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have supported the Government of Viet Nam to pilot an ‘Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence,’ which features a referral system, health care and protection. The pilot also supports the police and criminal justice system to enhance services to survivors of domestic violence. Training has increased the expertise of government personnel and researchers working on domestic violence, positioning them to undertake future costing exercises, and to feature relevant questions in national statistical surveys.

A compilation of lessons learned from the case studies highlights key recommendations for conducting costing studies, given their potential impacts: devote enough time to the preparatory phase for a costing study, including engaging the government to ensure ownership of the findings and a commitment to implement recommendations; consider the study’s scope, including clear definitions of what is included and what age range is selected; employ innovative and participatory approaches, such as a case study of a particular service or area; design the questionnaire to ensure that the methodology is culturally appropriate; produce and disseminate robust estimates; and develop an advocacy plan and use the findings at the outset, such as developing an advocacy plan to target key government leaders and engaging the media to maximize dissemination of the findings and raise awareness among the public and policymakers.

The tool proposes steps for Arab states to cost domestic violence, including considerations related to ethical guidance, site selection, data availability, and methodology and type of costs.

In many parts of the world, autumn is the time to gather the harvest and count our blessings. This year’s trials and tribulations have taught us that while we can count on blessings bestowed by other humans to overcome the COVID-19 crisis, we are wholly dependent on blessings bestowed by nature to survive and flourish.

The efforts to suppress the pandemic have limited our daily activities beyond mere inconvenience. They also made us realize that our lives are supported by a large number of essential personnel, including those who grow and deliver our food.

And the bigger truth that emerged from the pandemic is that human health is interlinked with the health of the planet. When we overstep the boundaries of nature’s tolerance, we open the gates for such unmitigated disasters as zoonotic diseases.

As humanity grows larger and wealthier, so does its demand for land to produce food and accommodate urban development. Almost three quarters of planetary land’s surface has already been transformed from its natural state, and the pace of conversion is accelerating, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the very foundation that supports our existence.

Land provides more than 99.7% of our calories. To feed the global population that is projected to reach ten billion by 2050, an extra 593 million hectares of agricultural land, an area nearly twice the size of India, will be required. If land conversion for agriculture continues at the current rate, only 10 per cent of land will be left in its natural state by 2050.

The good news is that while healthy land is finite in quantity, changes in consumer and corporate behaviors together with more efficient land use planning and management can help us meet the demand for essential goods and services without compromising our stock of productive land resources.

To protect ourselves, we must work together with nature. Land degradation neutrality is an international commitment (SDG Target 15.3) where countries work together to stop, prevent and reverse the loss of productive land. Already, 90 out of the 124 countries committed to achieving this goal have set voluntary national targets which amount to over 400 million hectares of land restoration. Land degradation neutrality is a framework that policymakers can use to address vulnerabilities in the global, regional and national economies exposed by the pandemic to address land degradation, food insecurity, sustainable development well-being and climate targets.

Healthy land is a safety net for everyone, but especially for such vulnerable groups as rural women and youth who rely on land for their livelihood. As we are gearing up for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the UN Food Systems Summit, we have a tremendous opportunity to invest in a healthy and sustainable relationship with nature, to grow, nourish and sustain not just ourselves, but our environment, as the World Food Day 2020 slogan proclaims. It is our new social contract for nature.

At home in Mauritania, we say “If you watch your pot, your food will not burn.” We can no longer accept the reality where over 820 million people are undernourished while one-third of all food produced each year is lost or wasted. Our inefficient consumption and production are a threat to the planet’s health and to our own future. We need to watch our pot, so that no one goes hungry today, with plenty of good food left over for tomorrow.

Uncategorized SDG Group: Leading Into The Next Normal Through the Power of Data & Analytics by Analytics Insight October 27, 2020

SDG Group is a Global Data & Analytics Consulting Firm, offering in-depth expertise that empowers its clients’ strategies to become data-driven enterprises and bridges the gap between data and business decisions.

With a global presence, the company’s mission is to transform data into better business decisions, making the results of its projects a core and sustainable differentiator for its clients. SDG Group believes in “Data As A Transformational Asset” (“D.A.T.A.”), meaning data is used as the basis for new ways of performing various functions and operating as a business.

The company has a technology-agnostic approach, which allows the firm to innovate its value proposition with the latest and best technologies to provide the ultimate data and analytics solutions in the market.

Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis

When the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world, SDG Group looked for opportunities to use its data and analytics expertise to help. They collaborated with global healthcare experts and used the latest technologies to develop, DocDot, a revolutionary AI-assisted remote diagnosis app, recognized by The World Health Organization (WHO) for being one of the most innovative digital health solutions worldwide. The app detects vital signs remotely to help healthcare professionals safely visit patients and enables the digital health taskforce to manage and monitor patients and customers through a Patient Management Dashboard.

SDG Group also collaborated with the Red Cross on its “Red Cross RESPONDS Plan.” The initiative takes action to address COVID-19 in all affected areas of society; emergencies, health, social inclusion, education, employment, and the environment. SDG Group deployed an Open Data Platform that made data centralized and current, and the actions of the Red Cross transparent to the public and key stakeholders.

Helping Clients Overcome New Challenges

In addition to assisting in healthcare and nonprofit organizations, SDG Group manages the pandemic’s impact on its clients. The company helps them create new strategies and solutions to thrive in the “next normal.”

A primary focus is moving data and analytics into the Cloud. SDG Group believes the Cloud is critical for reacting quickly to disruptions because it provides an agile, secure, scalable, and reliable way to extract data. The Cloud also enables its clients to focus more on getting value from data, instead of only spending time managing and maintaining infrastructure.

Another concentration related to the Cloud is Data Sharing. SDG Group believes that having a single data vision where there are no information silos is the most optimal way to address business challenges. The company facilitates Data Sharing within its clients and, in parallel, ensures they have reliable data and speak the same data language through effective Data Management and Data Governance practices.

Also, a Digital Analytics Strategy is more critical than ever now that digital channels are the only means for connecting with people and finding new business opportunities. SDG Group helps its clients discover new ways to reach their customers. With a customer-centric vision, the company developed SDG Eagle Digital Analytics, a solution that provides a comprehensive view of data from all channels.

The economy and recession are also concerns. Amid the pandemic, SDG Group launched the SDG CashFlow War Room Solution to provide its clients with visibility into cash flow to evaluate every possible scenario. The solution helps its clients better manage liquidity and pursue new growth opportunities.

Lastly, SDG Group uses disruptive technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, and Advanced Analytics as catalysts for innovation that will enable its clients to excel in a post-pandemic world.

Innovating the Data Value Chain to Accelerate Business Insights

The report shares highlights and trends based on data from 14 major sustainability standards for bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and forestry products.

‘The State of Sustainable Markets 2020: Statistics and Emerging Trends,’ provides data on area, production volume, and producers for 14 standard-setting organizations focused on the eight commodities and forestry. The report finds that the certified farmland of most of the eight crops is expanding: between 2014 and 2018, the certified area of all agricultural commodities covered in the report grew by 52%. Cotton has the largest certified area: 18.2% of land cultivated for cotton globally is now certified. Cocoa, oil palm, and coffee represent the crops with the next largest areas of certified land. Commodities with the smallest certified area are soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and bananas. Buyers of most of the eight crops are also making progress in establishing and disclosing sustainable sourcing commitments.

Organic represents the biggest sustainability standard for both area and product variety. In 2018, 1.5% of agricultural land worldwide was classified as organic. In forestry, two standards dominate. The forest area certified by Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) continues to exceed the forest area certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC): 7.7% of forest area is PEFC-certified, compared with 4.9% of global forest area certified under FSC.

The report highlights the role of consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainably grown products in driving the rising popularity of certified products like bananas, cocoa, and soybeans. At the same time, ITC’s Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton cautions against depending “on consumer sentiment alone” to drive sustainability and certification. Coke-Hamilton recommends engaging with multinational buyers and policymakers to see how they can scale the uptake of sustainability standards across additional goods and countries. Additional driving forces behind growth in sustainability include implementation of risk management strategies by private companies that source commodities from developing countries, and regulatory frameworks that establish commodity sourcing conditions in both producing and consuming countries.

On COVID-19, the authors note that the pandemic has increased stress on exporters of the products analyzed in the report. Within this context, the report emphasizes that voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use more environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices while also improving their competitiveness and differentiating their product offerings.

ITC launched this fifth global report at the ITC Good Trade Summit, which took place virtually from 7-8 October on the theme, ‘Emerging Stronger from the COVID-19 Crisis.’ ITC produced the report in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), with financial support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.

CMU says its “Voluntary University Review” is the first in the world, adding that it “sends a strong signal that universities are a critical partner” in achieving the SDGs.

To conduct the review, the university pulled together a team including students, professors and staff who reviewed published information about Carnegie Mellon’s activities, writes Inside Higher Ed. The review included 17 Zoom meetings, each organized around one of the SDGs. Initial findings will be supplemented by additional information provided by CMU community members over the 2020/2021 academic year.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

273,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wef-report-describes-digital-trade-trends-challenges-in-asia/,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WEF Report Describes Digital Trade Trends, Challenges in Asia","The Global Future Council on International Trade and Investment has identified seven digital trade trends in Asia, and highlighted challenge areas for digital trade policy, in a community paper published by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

The paper titled, ‘Advancing Digital Trade in Asia,’ considers how officials across Asia have responded to the explosive growth of digital trade in the region. Noting that digital trade is not new – the World Trade Organization (WTO) created a work programme on the matter in 1998 – the paper emphasizes the importance of the digital economy, which has been reinforced by COVID-19 and associated lockdowns.

However, the authors emphasize that multiple and changing definitions of ‘digital trade’ do not always align with existing trade agreements, which can fail to capture four key dimensions of the term: 1) digital goods and services (e.g. software); 2) tangible goods and services delivered digitally (e.g. apparel); 3) digital enablers of trade in tangible goods (e.g. logistics tracking); and 4) emerging transformative digital technologies (e.g. blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI)). Accordingly, the paper examines new trends, and considers how digital trade deals and other regulatory responses, like the application of digital taxation policies, may affect the growth of digital trade in Asia.

The paper identifies seven overarching trends in digital trade:

the rise of digital ecosystems and increasing connectivity in the region; linkages by regional platforms, or “unicorns” that may be less familiar outside the region; Asian firms’ leading position in providing digital/physical interfaces, powered by 5G; the increasing role of Asia as a hub for cloud services, including data collection and analytics; consumers’ increasing preference for subscription services, including livestreaming; growing numbers of applications that solve digital financial services and payments gaps; and the growing potential for misuse or harm that could flow from digitally connected devices and users.

Noting that these trends are often picked up by or accounted for in trade agreements – including the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), and the Digital Economy Agreement (DEA) – the paper flags that agreements from the region have been at the forefront of rule making on digital trade issues. These agreements generally aim to reduce trade barriers to the digital economy, the paper summarizes, and build compatible standards to facilitate interoperability and cross-border consumer trust. The paper compares the DEA, DEPA, and CPTPP across 23 digital trade provisions, highlighting whether the provisions are identical across the agreements, whether a provision in one agreement is more or less comprehensive than the others, and if a similar provision is lacking in the agreement.

The report identifies five challenge areas for digital trade policies that have emerged as key points for debate, where governments are struggling to reach consensus despite having made progress via the above agreements. Challenges remain on data transfer mechanisms, consumer protection, digital trade facilitation, emerging technologies, and digital taxation policies.

The WEF’s Global Future Council on International Trade and Investment is a multi-stakeholder and interdisciplinary knowledge network dedicated to promoting innovative thinking to shape a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future. The Council aims to help stakeholders make sense of the new global economic landscape and signal developments on the horizon.

274,https://www.newagebd.net/article/120128/waste-management-in-sdg,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",newagebd.net,Waste management in SDG,"A New Age file photo shows a pile of wastes filling up a canal at Rasulpur at Kamrangirchar in Dhaka. — Indrajit Kumer Ghosh

PEOPLE use wide a range of goods for their livelihood, comfort and amenities. The use or consumption pattern of goods varies because of changes in the way of life, predominantly contributed by economic development, technological diversity and population growth. The goods that people use for sustenance are discarded as they reach the end of their use. Waste management comes at play in protect the environment to manage the discarded goods.

The goods that people use can be divided into two principal categories: solid and liquid. Different streams of wastes originate from these two categories. Streams of wastes like perishable household wastes, construction and demolition wastes, electronic and electrical wastes, rubber, metal, glass, plastic, hazardous medical wastes, etc originate from the solid waste category. Industrial effluent, grey water, black water, paints, chemicals, etc fall in the category of liquid waste. Wastes in each of these categories and streams have the potential to damage every fabric of the environment. To prevent any harmful effects, each waste stream is handled in different ways.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are an urgent call for action by all countries, developed and developing, in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The common purpose and objective of both waste management and Agenda 2030 are to protect the environment for human benefits. The goals that the Agenda 2030 adopted for a sustainable development involve a range of functions and activities. Those functions and activities are also found in waste management. The 3R — reduce, reuse and recycle — approach in waste management is recognised globally. It encompasses a series of activities with contribution to the environment and society. For example, reuse activities create jobs, save energy, cut disposal costs, reduce the use of virgin raw materials, reduce CO2 emission, extend life of landfill and reduce pressure on land.

Waste management value addition

Goal 1 has the target to ‘end poverty in all its form everywhere’ through the development of social protection systems with targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. Waste management prevents the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbon, CO2, etc which improves environmental degradation narrowing down the risk of human vulnerability to natural disaster. Waste management also prevents the pollution of water, another area of human vulnerability.

Goal 2 eyes ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Food security is a global concern against the backdrop of the population growth and shrinking agricultural land which include cropland, forest, mangrove forest, river, lake, tea estate and salt span etc. Countries are losing agricultural land every year because of population settlement, infrastructure development, industrialisation, etc.

Food loss and waste annually contribute to 3.3 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. If a fourth of the food loss or wastes across the globe could be avoided, it could feed 750 million people. Food loss and waste affect the food supply chain, lowering income for food producers and wholesalers, increase consumer cost for food and constrain the access of low income groups to food. Minimising food loss, which waste management compliments, can improve food security and environmental gains.

Goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all in all stages. In Bangladesh, there is a large informal recycling sector in different streams of wastes. The glass recycling sector recycles about 180,000 tonnes of discarded container glasses every year. According to industry sources, the economic value of this quantity of discarded glasses at waste pickers’ level is estimated at Tk 180 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 1 a kilogram. The value of glass recyclables at the wholesaler level is estimated at Tk 450 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 2.50 a kilogram. It is estimated that annually about 96,000 tonnes of plastic waste is recycled across the country. This plastic waste has Tk 288 million in economic value at the waste picker level. Recycling has created employment for thousands of people which gives them an earning.

Goal 6 ensures an available and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Leachate percolating from decomposing waste goes into surface and ground water systems, if not protected. Given the composition and character, municipal solid waste can contain 20–50 per cent of water which it releases as it decomposes. Leachates, if not treated, contaminate ground and surface water. Besides leachate, millions of litres of black water and industry effluents from households and factories are also released into the environment. These are elements of a potential contamination of surface and ground water and it happens quietly. For example, one gallon of paint can contaminate 10 million gallons of drinking water. Waste management requires the treatment of all liquid wastes before being discharged into the environment. This requirement has a direct contribution to ‘sustainable management of water and sanitation’. There are instances that large water body such as rivers, lakes, etc get ruined when ‘waste management’ does not work.

Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Waste treatment technology producing biogas and power from waste provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces waste volume, mitigating pressure on land for waste disposal which can contribute to food security. Second, the residual of biogas can be converted into compost to use as soil stabiliser. Biogas from organic wastes or furnace oil from tyre recycling can be used as additional fuel in waste-to-energy plant where waste has low calorific value. Residuals in waste-to-energy plant, ie bottom ash, can be converted into slag and slag can be used in cement industry to produce bricks, slabs, etc, which can be used in construction works such as the preparation of road base, footpath, etc. The reuse of glass items from cullet consumes 40 per cent less energy than making new glasses from virgin raw materials on the grounds because cullet dissolves at a much lower temperature. Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 per cent. Around 900 litres of oil, a person’s two months’ water use and two people’s energy consumption for a year, can be saved by recycling just one tonne of plastic wastes.

Goal 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation. Waste management through the promotion of the reduction approach encourages industries to produce less waste in the production process where innovation is the key. Industry to sustain in the long term needs to have in-house waste management like effluent treatment plants to treat liquid wastes. Through the reuse approach, waste management promotes an extended use of product and also alternative use through recycling.

Goal 11 makes cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Human settlements in cities and towns cannot be safe with heaps of garbage on their front yard or backyard. Waste management through community activities can involve people to do their part of waste management for a safer living environment.

As countries develop, more urbanisation takes place and construction and demolition waste, a harmful component of waste stream, is on the rise. Generally, the largest part of construction and demolition material is concrete, which encompasses around 70 per cent of waste generated before recycling. There is a range of environmental and economic benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it in a landfill.

The benefits include cheaper source of aggregate, reduction in landfill space required for concrete debris, using recycled material as gravel that reduces the need for gravel mining and, increasingly, high-grade aggregate for road construction is available only at greater distances, increasing the associated economic and environmental cost impacts associated with the longer haulage distances versus using recycled aggregate.

Goal 12 targets a sustainable consumption and production pattern. Sustainable consumption and production is about the use of products and manufacturing process of products that will produce minimal waste, which invokes the 3R approach of waste management. The 3R approach minimises resource consumption in the level sufficient for basic need, which is the reduce component, use goods and materials until they can be repaired or fixed to perform its function recurrently, which is the reuse component, and reprocess the materials being discarded into new products, which is the recycle component. This approach increases resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable consumption and production. For example, it takes 1.5 tonnes of water, 22 kilograms of chemicals and 243 litres of fossil fuel to produce one computer. An extended use of a product can reduce the consumption of water, chemical and fossil fuel and also reduce waste generation. Its overall impact comes on environmental improvement.

Goal 13 encourages urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. As decay starts, waste emits methane, a greenhouse gas, impacting climate change. The emission of methane is visible in landfill during the dry season. Methane is also a cause of fire in the landfill. As waste burns, CO2 is generated. CO2 is another greenhouse gas. The contribution of the 3R approach to mitigating climate change is found in waste, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land use change and forestry sectors. In the waste sector, methane emission is reduced by gas recovery in the landfill. Energy recovered from waste reduces emissions from fossil fuel. Reduction in food loss and waste is an action in the agricultural sector to combat climate change. Food loss and waste represent the wastage of resources, including the land, water, labour, and energy resource used to produce food. It strongly contributes to climate change because greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution activities, and methane is released during the decay of food waste.

Goal 14 conserves and sustainably uses the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 6, 12 and 14 are interlinked. An uneconomical consumption of materials in production and irresponsible discharge of waste combined with absence of waste management has not ensured the availability and sustainable management of water bodies like the River Buriganga, the River Turag and the River Balu. An irresponsible discharge of plastics in the world oceans threaten marine lives.

Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manages forests, combats desertification and halts and reverses land degradation and halts biodiversity loss. Activities embedded and innovations in the 3R approach have all potentials to address the issues stated in Goal 15 on Agenda 2030.

The SDGs are for public good to improve different facets of environmental sustainability. Goals are attached to human well-being and environmental improvement through a series of activities. A wide range of activities in waste management are naturally aligned with the SDGs. An improved waste management directly complements the achievement of the SDG. While 11 of the 17 goals get direct contribution, 6 receives indirect support from waste management.

“We don’t want spraying at the guardrails, it’s our right to not have leakage,” Faubert said during the presentation. “Obviously this will happen again if you spray (the guardrail area). . . you have a bylaw giving us a right to put up (the signs). We need to know the no spray bylaw is abided by.”

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Diane Faubert at the virtual meeting detailed a “significant incident” back in mid-July when a stretch of pesticide spraying over two metres wide was done along County Road 43 guardrails, located between organic farms in the Alexandria area and where “no spray” signs are posted. She said the guardrails are above a steep embankment, and that the chemicals leaked onto the farmland below.

SDG council’s committee of the whole got into the weeds Wednesday, when a delegation presented regarding “no spray” signs and landowner concerns.

Faubert says she’s all in favour of roadside mowing, but why is the “excellent solution” of whipper snipping at the guard rails being abandoned in favour of pesticides?

Faubert said the signs have been going up for 11 years, and she thanked SDG for never spraying in that area, until 2020. She said her farms include conservation wetlands, organic fields and swamps, and beehives and honey bees, insects that are at-risk if there’s spraying.

Faubert spoke about 270 acres of organic land, all managed without spraying any “dangerous chemicals.” She said 8,000 trees were planted last year on her land, that lawnmowers are “used around every single tree” and that there’s “not one iota” of herbicide used, yet those trees are doing very well.

When councillors commented on Faubert’s presentation, Coun. Carma Williams struck a conciliatory tone, saying “I happen to be sensitive to the contents of your delegation today. . . we have to modernize our thinking, how we deal with (signs).

“In the future we have to be more respectful with regards to spraying.”

Coun. Steven Byvelds said as an agriculturalist, he found Faubert’s “blanket statement” that all spraying is bad to be an overstatement, and the science on the issue has to be followed.

“There’s a balance (to strike), but we can certainly work together on making that balance happen,” he said. “I look forward to (the debate at county council).”

Faubert said she agreed with the spirit of compromising, but “we also have no spray signs – those have to be respected. . . it’s not easy to put up those signs, it’s a lot of work. I’d appreciate them being respected.”

Byvelds in a follow-up comment said SDG crews did make “an error by spraying in your area.”

Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

After two deadlocked secret ballots today at County Council, the Mayor of South Glengarry came out on top when the winner’s name was drawn from a hat to settle the role.

Fraser, North Dundas mayor, had put his name forward as a candidate in the annual vote for warden at the County Council table, alongside the incumbent Prevost, South Glengarry mayor.

‘Warden’ is the title for the head of council at the upper-tier SDG municipal government. The position is not directly elected by the people but is instead decided each fall by the 12 local mayors and deputy mayors serving on the Cornwall-based council.

Today’s initial vote produced a 6-6 tie, a result replicated on a second try. So CAO Tim Simpson and Clerk Helen Thomson placed all of the ballots into a hat, and Thomson announced Prevost’s re-appointment after reaching in to decide the matter.

While it was the third time in recent memory a vote for warden has been decided this way, the result produced the first three-time warden in SD&G’s 170-year history.

“It is an honour to be named Warden of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry for a third time,” said Prevost, who first served in the position in 2000 before being returned to the role for a second time late last year. “COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the residents and businesses of SDG over this year. I look forward to meeting the challenges of 2021 and with the help of my colleagues around the council table, as well as administration, we will work to ensure a strengthened new year for everyone.”

Both contenders for the position agreed the prosperity of the United Counties was paramount in light of the global pandemic.

“I congratulate and look forward to working alongside Warden Frank Prevost, as well as my council colleagues, as we are all committed to doing our best for the residents of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry in the year to come,” said Fraser.

Prevost, the South Glengarry mayor and incumbent warden, and North Dundas Coun. Tony Fraser, were vying for the position, and the two were deadlocked after two rounds of voting at the end of the regular meeting on Monday morning. So, Helen Thomson, director of council services/clerk, was called upon to make the pick.

Prevost thanked everyone at the table for their continued support, and said “I certainly won’t let you down, and I’m very hopeful to be able to get out into more communities in 2021 (than has been possible much of this year).”

Prevost and Fraser put their names forward late in September.

Prevost in announcing his candidacy said he felt quite short-changed this year of the pandemic – much of what the warden does in the community couldn’t happen because of COVID-19 limitations. Just before Monday’s vote, he reiterated that point, saying he’s felt somewhat cheated during the current term. Prevost was warden two decades ago, but he didn’t think that was a reason to not seek a second consecutive modern-day term.","Article contentFrank Prevost has been voted as the next warden of SDG council.

Montoya, executive director of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), was appointed recently by UN Secretary General António Guterres as one of the 15 eminent scientists to draft the 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), said a UN official announcement in New York City.

“We are honored to be selected as part of the distinguished experts to author a very significant report on the global SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],” Montoya said in a DOST-PCHRD news release.

“Being a health research scientist in the Philippines, a developing country, enables us to contribute unique and substantial information that is relevant to sustainable development. It is without a doubt that I assure our UN member states and our fellow Filipinos that our efforts will always be directed towards the benefit of all through science and technology,” he added.

Philippine Science Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña, in a news release, said he is “very happy about the announcement” of the appointment of Montoya to be among the authors of GSDR.

“The whole DOST family is very proud of this recognition given to Dr. Montoya,” de la Peña said in the news release posted on DOST’s Facebook account.

Produced once every four years, the SDG report aims to employ the scientific perspective in guiding policy-makers on the state of global sustainable development, and serve as a “strong evidence-based instrument” in eradicating poverty.

The report will also feed the “high-level global review” of the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations in September 2030.

The designation of the independent group followed an extensive consultation process that involved nominations from UN member states which concluded in December 2019.

The 15 scientists were selected by Guterres to author the GSDR and conduct a follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for SDGs.

The “diverse group,” according to the UN, represents a wide range of disciplines and are composed of the following scientists: John Agard (Trinidad and Tobago), Kaltham Ali Al-Ghanim (Qatar), Sergey N. Bobylev (Russian Federation), Opha Pauline Dube, (Botswana), Ibrahima Hathie (Senegal), Norichika Kanie (Japan), Nyovani Janet Madise (Malawi), Shirin Malekpour (Australia), J. Jaime Miranda (Peru), Jaime C Montoya (Philippines), Jiahua Pan (China), Åsa Persson (Sweden), Ambuj D Sagar (India), Imme Scholz (Germany), Nancy Shackell (Canada).

Led by Agard and Scholz, the independent group will author the second report of its kind. The first GSDR has been released in September of 2019 titled, “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development.”

PCHRD is at the forefront of the country’s fight against the current Covid-19 pandemic.

As the country’s lead coordinator for health research and development initiatives, PCHRD supports Filipino researchers in health research innovation, policy recommendations, and technology commercialization.

It provides scholarships to Filipino students in the field of health and medicine, and establishes information and communication systems to disseminate health research information both for local and international stakeholders.","“We are honored to be selected as part of the distinguished experts to author a very significant report on the global SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],” Montoya said in a DOST-PCHRD news release.

Self-checkout units could be set up at libraries in SDG if Safe Restart Funding were to eventually include capital expenditures.

That was one of the messages delivered at the SDG council committee of the whole virtual meeting on Monday by director of financial services Rebecca Russell during a key information report.

Russell said self-checkout at library branches could be “quite beneficial at this time,” but those units are costly – approximately $10,000.

This summer Ontario announced it would be providing municipalities with $1.6 billion in a first round of emergency funding due to the pandemic, the SRF Agreement resulting in approximately $1.7 million for SDG to assist with the financial burden, but it’s money eligible only for revenue losses and operating expenses.

If new cases continue on the pace they are being confirmed this month, the EOHU could break 100 or more cases this month by Halloween.

The EOHU reported a new hospitalized case on Monday, bringing the total currently in hospital to four. At least one is being treated in Ottawa, where the others are being tended to has not been disclosed. None of the four is in an intensive care unit.

There are now three active outbreaks at congregated care settings within the EOHU, but the health unit’s outbreak page does not indicate where the third one is located. COVID-19 outbreaks are listed at Foyer St-Jacques Nursing Home in Embrun (started Sept. 14) and at the Residence Prescott-Russell (started Oct. 7).

The EOHU’s next scheduled briefing is on Tuesday afternoon.","The number of active cases is a bit higher than Friday, at 90, as the 15 new cases were offset by other cases being set as resolved by the EOHU.
All of the new cases since Friday afternoon’s EOHU update are located in Prescott-Russell and SDG, with cases added on Monday as follows: one each in Clarence-Rockland, Champlain, Hawkesbury, and South Glengarry; three in North Glengarry; and, two in Russell.

Arena openings across SDG have it looking more like fall

Article content LONG SAULT — It’s starting to look a lot more like fall and winter sports and recreation season in Williamstown, Long Sault and other parts of the region. Long Sault Arena reopened late in September, after being closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And, on Monday the township announced public skating and stick-and-puck at the arena returns this season – and will be free of charge. The schedule of sessions is set to begin on Oct. 14, and online registration will be required, as there are limited spots available. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Arena openings across SDG have it looking more like fall Back to video There’ll be four public skating sessions per week, including two on Sundays (11-11:50 a.m., 3-3:50 p.m.). There’ll also be free public skating on Mondays (10-10:50 a.m.) and Thursdays (10-10:50 a.m). The Benson Centre in Cornwall in July was the first facility in the region to have an ice pad available, and the Township of South Glengarry recently reopened the ice surface at the Char-Lan Recreation Centre in Williamstown, with numerous safety measures in place.

Article content “We’ve implemented important safety measures in direct consultation with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit under Stage 3,” said Rick Ladouceur, director of recreation and facilities, in a township news release. “We’re all in this together and want to ensure everyone has a safe return to the ice this season. The upgrades and guidelines we’ve implemented will help accomplish this.” Facility users are being greeted with a sign-in process upon entry to maintain contact tracing security. There’s freshly painted spectator seating areas, distanced and marked appropriately to maintain a two-metre distance, and high-standard electro-sanitation packs are being used between each reservation. Recreation co-ordinator Cathy McDonell in the news release said township staff have “worked diligently these past few months in preparation of welcoming back the community. . . we’re excited to finally have our doors re-open, and are currently accepting reservations for icetime bookings in (the remainder of October).” In early September, North Glengarry announced its two arenas – the Glengarry Sports Palace in Alexandria, and the Maxville & District Sports Complex – would have staggered openings, with an anticipated early October opening in Alexandria, followed later in the fall by the sports complex. The Alexandria Minor Hockey Association has also taken to the ice – the Glens’ first group will be the U-17 level, who had time scheduled late on Wednesday afternoon.

Article content Procedures that need to be followed will include all players arriving at the arena fully dressed, except for skates, gloves and helmets. And, due to the limit of 50 people in the stands, only one parent per child will be admitted to the facility. In South Dundas, the Morrisburg Arena re-opened late last week. The municipality prepared a video that highlighted the regulations that are in place during the pandemic, and the complete operations plan is also available. Ice time can be booked by calling the arena, and there are also numerous free public skating sessions, including moms, tots and seniors on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 10:30-11:30 a.m. each of the two days. The municipality also had announced registration is open for fall recreation programming, which includes yoga, kickboxing, and high-intensity interval training, at the Iroquois Civic Centre and Matilda Hall. In North Dundas, the ice season that got underway in late September got busier this week in Winchester and Chesterville, with the Family Stick and Puck Program. There are sessions in Winchester on Monday and Saturday afternoons, and in Chesterville on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons.

289,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-risk-of-losing-the-2030-agenda-in-brazil/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Risk of Losing the 2030 Agenda in Brazil,"By Alessandra Nilo and Claudio Fernandes

COVID-19 found a perfect storm in Brazil, which has the sixth-largest population in the world and the seventh-highest level of inequality.

The health and economic crises triggered by the pandemic have exposed our multiple inequalities. While Brazil’s population is now paying the high price of pandemic unpreparedness and government irresponsibility, the planet is bound to pay an even longer-lasting price for environmental recklessness and devastation.

This warning comes from 105 specialists from the Civil Society Working Group for the 2030 Agenda in the latest Spotlight Report on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Brazil, which monitors the implementation of the SDGs. This fourth edition is based on the analysis of 145 of the 169 global SDG targets. The report shows that there is no progress in 88% of the environmental targets – only two out of 91 show progress. In addition, more than a third show regression, another third is either threatened or stagnant, and 17.6% of them have no data available.

Environmental Issues: Worsening Statistics, Shrinking Resources

Deforestation hit a record level this year, increasing by 35% in the Amazon (between June 2019 and June 2020) and 30% in the tropical Atlantic Forest, which had already lost 75% of its area throughout history. While 43 million people were hit by droughts, the 2019 budget on disaster prevention was the lowest in 11 years, and less than a third of it was disbursed.

The report shows also an increase in pollution, land grabbing conflicts, and violence against indigenous people and human rights defenders. In this context, it must take a great deal of disregard for governing for the current administration to cut bodies of democratic governance, keep civil society out of discussions, and lose international partners in the Amazonian Protection Fund, which resulted in stopping disbursement for projects led by CSOs[1].

Moreover, due to the administration’s lack of transparency, we do not have recent data on subsidies for fossil fuels, internal consumption of solid materials, or the amount of hazardous waste generated or disposed.

Economic and Social Issues: Less Public Money, More Inequality

The pandemic is highlighting the consequences of fiscal austerity policies. As those policies were implemented, legislation that increases inequality was simultaneously reinforced. A 2016 constitutional amendment established a cap on public investment in health, education, science and technology, and social assistance, effectively transferring wealth from the bottom to financial investors for the resources cut from the programmes used to pay off debt interests. It is not surprising that, of the 85 SDG targets linked to the social dimension analyzed in the report, 68% show no advancement whatsoever in the last two years (2018-2019).

In 2019, when 77 million people (37% of the population) lacked access to basic sanitation and unemployment, and job informality rose sharply, only 1.26% of Brazil’s federal budget targeted poverty reduction programmes, the same ratio since 2016. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) will have to update its hunger map because, according to our National Statistical and Geographic Institute (IBGE), hunger in Brazil reached more than 5% of the population for the first time since 2013.

Other social indicators are also worrying, including:

Brazil is the fourth, in absolute numbers, in child marriage and sexual abuse cases against children and adolescents. In 2019, these were the highest since 2011[2].

Violence against women and LGBTI+ population increased, while the budget for the VAW Program decreased 75% in the past five years.

HIV infections have increased in the North and Northeast regions (the poorest ones) and follow a pattern that points to structural racism: black people make up 60% of the deaths associated with HIV in these regions.

Governance Issues: Perceptions, Rights, and Regulations

Corruption in Brazil has worsened for three years in a row, based on citizens’ perceptions. In 2019, out of 180 countries, Brazil occupied the 106th position in the Corruption Perception Index, and saw a 20.1% increase in deaths from police intervention alongside the dismantling of the social participation policy: the National SDG Commission created in 2016 was dissolved by Presidential Decree 9.759 in April 2019. This decree also affected approximately 500 commissions and councils that had the participation of civil society representatives.

The Brazilian federal administration is openly opposed to the 2030 Agenda, as evidenced by its deregulating policies, weakening environmental protection agencies, and denying science and the climate emergency. The latest attack on the SDGs was published on 26 October 2020: Presidential Decree 10.531/2020 replaces the 2030 Agenda with the Federal Strategic Development Plan 2031. The plan seeks to justify a proposed regressive tax reform, policies of privatization for health and education, and social exclusion by reinforcing the traditional binary family arrangement, among other things[3].

It is symptomatic that while we are experiencing an extraordinary public health event, specialists are being replaced by unqualified military personnel. The current Minister of Health – Brazil’s third since February – is an Army General ready to follow the science-denying orders from the President.

Many of the rights-based accords currently in the multilateral arena were negotiated with leadership and participation of the Brazilian diplomatic corps. These same agreements are under threat at the national level, a situation that affects people and planet beyond our own borders. Losing Brazil on the path to sustainable development and environmental responsibility is a risk neither Latin America nor the world can afford, especially in this accelerated Decade of Action.

290,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-shows-sdg-data-trends-with-interactive-atlas/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Illustrates SDG Data Trends with Interactive Atlas,"The World Bank has released the 2020 edition of its SDG Atlas. This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

291,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/wto-members-mull-easing-restrictions-on-humanitarian-food-aid/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: WTO Members Mull Easing Restrictions on Humanitarian Food Aid,"Negotiators at the World Trade Organization (WTO) are considering a proposal from Singapore that would ensure humanitarian food aid is exempt from export prohibitions and restrictions, ahead of the trade body’s General Council meeting on 16 December.

Proponents say the move will make it faster and easier for the World Food Program (WFP) to provide urgently-needed assistance to save the lives of people in crisis situations – and ensure that trade rules support progress towards SDG 2, which commits governments to ending hunger and malnutrition.

The move follows a declaration by agriculture ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) on 21 April, reaffirming their agreement to exempt from export restrictions food bought for humanitarian purposes by the WFP.

After a wave of food price spikes in the late 2000s, G20 leaders made a similar statement at their Cannes summit in November 2011 – although disagreement among WTO members prevented the trade body adopting an agreement on the issue at its ministerial conference in Geneva one month later.

This year, the issue has again risen up the trade agenda as several countries initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by restricting food exports, raising concern that poor consumers in net food-importing countries would face difficulties in accessing food. Although many such measures have since been lifted, WFP staff told an informal WTO meeting on 10 November that the organization had faced difficulties procuring humanitarian aid in the new market and policy environment.

With the WFP now set to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its work to combat hunger, especially in conflict-affected areas, trade officials acknowledged that there was increased awareness of the agency’s work, and a stronger determination among WTO members to support it. “It would be a good moment for the WTO to deliver”, one developing country trade official told IISD.

Growing momentum

Around 30 countries would be willing to co-sponsor Singapore’s initiative, which would take the form of a General Council decision, trade sources told IISD. Furthermore, as many as 50 members are believed to have expressed support for the move. Countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific are among those co-sponsoring the proposal, including those which are recipients of food aid.

Support is also spread across different world regions and negotiating coalitions, including both exporting and importing countries, and those classed as developed, developing, and least developed countries (LDCs) at the WTO.

On 23 November, a virtual ministerial meeting of the cross-regional Ottawa Group of trade ministers discussed the proposal and “agreed to encourage” its adoption by the wider WTO membership, according to a press release issued after the event. The meeting was convened by Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, Mary Ng.

Sources told IISD that the EU is also consulting internally on the proposal, while the US has spoken in support of the move, and China voiced cautious support. The LDCs are reportedly also in favor, along with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group, although some countries in the group are seeking to address the concern that food aid procurement could exacerbate domestic shortages. India is the only WTO member to express objections to the proposal in its current form, trade officials said.

However, negotiators said some countries’ concerns may have been allayed by the WFP’s presentation for WTO members, which emphasized the agency’s “do no harm” principle underlying its procurement policy. WFP Chief Economist Arif Husain outlined the steps the organization took to support food security through its food purchases, as well as describing the obstacles which food export restrictions create for the safe, timely, and efficient delivery of humanitarian aid.

Both rice and maize procurement had both been affected by export restrictions, Husain said. In the case of maize, procurement costs were higher, and deliveries took two to three times longer, resulting in the loss of at least 3.9 million meals. In the case of rice, food aid to West Africa was delayed by at least one month, and rice procurement prices rose by 20 percent.

WFP Executive Director David Beasley has also spoken out in support of the initiative, telling a meeting of the agency’s Executive Board in November that the proposal “will help us save both money and time in reaching the most destitute.” He asked Board members to urge their governments to support the exemption.

Seven issues

The topic of export restrictions is one of seven issues on the agenda of the WTO agriculture committee’s negotiating body. Members are also discussing: domestic support to the farm sector; the issue of public food stockholding; market access issues, such as tariffs and other border measures; a “special safeguard mechanism” for developing countries; export competition, including export subsidies and comparable measures; and cotton.

The chair of the WTO agriculture negotiations, Costa Rica’s Ambassador Gloria Abraham Peralta, has asked facilitators to support her efforts to identify potential areas of consensus on the seven negotiating issues. Leonardo Rocha Bento (Brazil) is facilitating the talks on export restrictions, and, alongside other facilitators, reported back on his discussions to date at the 10 November meeting.

Most members consider there is positive momentum towards a General Council, Rocha Bento told the meeting. However, there was less consensus around a separate question concerning how governments could best improve transparency when food export restrictions are imposed.

Prospects for progress

Rocha Bento is due to convene an informal meeting open to all WTO members on 26 November to hear their views on the issue and discuss possible ways forward.

Progress on WTO agriculture negotiations has been slowed by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, negotiators said, with the postponement of the next WTO ministerial conference one factor affecting the dynamic in the talks. The transition to a new administration in the US and the delay in concluding the selection process for the new WTO Director-General have also affected the mood among members and the political context for the negotiations.

However, trade officials were at pains to emphasize that WFP food aid represents only a tiny fraction of total global trade in food – and that humanitarian principles, rather than traditional trade issues, were at stake. “We’re just trying to help WFP to do its life-saving work”, one supporter of the proposal told IISD.

A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

It provides practical information on steps that countries may take when preparing VNRs, presenting the VNR report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and following up after the HLPF.

VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Conducted voluntarily by national governments, the reviews are intended to track progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs at the country level, and comprise part of the follow-up and review of the Agenda. Since 2016, 205 VNRs have been presented by 168 countries. For the 2021 session, 43 countries are expected to present a VNR.

The 2021 VNR handbook was released in November 2020 as an updated version of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 editions. The 2021 edition recommends that countries include a section on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDG implementation, measures undertaken to ensure a sustainable, green recovery, and impacts on VNR preparations.

The handbook notes that the ten countries conducting their first VNR will be allocated 30 minutes. These countries are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and San Marino.

The 33 countries presenting second and third VNRs will present them in a panel format with 20 minutes each during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF. Twenty-four countries are conducting their second reviews: Bahamas, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, Chad, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Namibia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Nine countries are conducting their third reviews: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The handbook makes specific recommendations for countries preparing a VNR for the second or third time, including that countries should show progress made since their first VNR, and avoid repeating information presented in a previous VNR. The handbook encourages countries to address how they overcome challenges in SDG implementation and share lessons learned and good practices adopted.

On UN support for countries’ VNR preparations, the handbook notes that DESA is organizing three global workshops for working-level officials closely engaged in the national preparatory process, as follows:

October-November 2020: A virtual workshop to facilitate peer learning and exchange between countries conducting VNRs in 2021 and those that have previously carried out VNRs, as well as to cover key components of the preparatory process;

Spring 2021: In-depth exchanges on the preparation and presentation process, drafting sections of the VNR report, and presenting the VNR report; and

On 11 July 2021 in New York, US, a workshop covering final preparatory matters and addressing anticipated follow-up to the VNRs.

In addition, the five UN Regional Commissions are expected to organize workshops on the margins of their respective regional sustainable development fora to discuss regional specificities and lessons learned by previous VNR countries.

On deadlines, governments must submit main messages – the principal findings of the review – by 2 May 2021. The final VNR report is due on 11 June 2021.

The handbook concludes with suggestions for concrete follow-up steps after the HLPF. These include: presenting outcomes of the VNR presentation at the HLPF in a press conference; debriefing the VNR project team on the outcomes of the HLPF presentation; and sharing the VNR at the regional level. Further, the handbook suggests that countries promote concrete action on priorities contained in the VNR, such as through convening a cabinet meeting to consider VNR follow-up, and developing an action plan or road map that addresses the “who, what, where and when” of priority actions.

Will COVID-19 push the SDGs to the back of the global agenda, or will it underscore the persistent need for sustainable development? The answer depends in part on how the 2030 Agenda survives this “stress test” of its first five years. In our latest article, published in Journal of International Business Policy, we look into this question, and suggest three ways for the SDGs to help make societies more equitable after COVID-19.

COVID-19: A Stress Test for the SDGs

COVID-19 is exposing the true relevance of the SDGs. Before the pandemic, assessments on how the world is doing on achieving the SDGs already painted a bleak picture of widening inequality, more hunger, alarming erosion of ecosystems and biodiversity loss, and continued global warming.

Prioritizing economic growth over social inclusion and the environment undermines the “systems logic” of the SDGs.

COVID-19 further deteriorates progress: the resulting economic crisis is estimated to push 400 million people into abject poverty, meaning they will have to get by on less than USD1.90 a day. Moreover, the disruption of food value chains is estimated to double the number of people likely to face acute food shortages to 265 million. And as the virus is particularly affecting people living in poverty and those with underlying health conditions, COVID-19 is expected to exacerbate inequality.

Scientists have suggested that two-thirds of the SDGs are unlikely to be met amid a pandemic, and countries therefore should better define their priorities, and focus on a few broad strategic goals rather than all 17 SDGs. The editorial team of Nature added that it now is time to revise the SDGs to make them more achievable. This criticism echoes an early critique from the Copenhagen Consensus group that the 2030 Agenda has too many goals and too few priorities.

Others are not so sure. One group of scientists stated, also in Nature, that “great feats are rarely a product of lowered ambition” and the pandemic only “reinforces why the goals were established in the first place: to chart a better course towards common economic, social and environmental ambitions that will guarantee humanity’s long-term future.” The UN itself underscores this position and has not suggested revising or narrowing the sustainable development agenda. On the contrary, it has doubled down on the SDGs, asserting that they are “vital for a [COVID-19] recovery that leads to greener, more inclusive economies, and stronger, more resilient societies.”

Therefore, although it is good to remain critical about the design of the SDGs, they are likely to represent the best framework for navigating societies through the pandemic, and towards resilience and sustainability. COVID-19 is truly a stress test for the SDGs in general, and its universal and integrative ambitions in particular.

The Three-Part Logic of the SDGs

We argue that the SDGs provide three distinct “logics” that could help make societies more equitable after COVID-19. After the SDGs were adopted in 2015, a wave of reports, road maps, websites, and research papers investigated how the Goals could best be achieved. This has increased the world community’s intelligence on how to create more sustainable and resilient societies.

In our paper, we identify three types of logic illustrated by the SDGs: (1) a governance logic, (2) a systems logic, and (3) a strategic logic. These could facilitate a sustainable transformation during this crisis and beyond. But each faces significant hurdles.

First, according to the governance logic of the SDGs, progress takes place by setting policy goals at the macro level, creating policies to achieve them, and measuring progress over time. The 2030 Agenda provides 17 SDGs with 169 targets and 232 approved indicators to guide this process. Policies are increasingly being formulated to achieve these. Vast data gaps in measuring progress remain, but they are gradually filled.

The way many governments have been dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, with ad hoc and fragmented approaches, has actually created a key hurdle for effective action. Short-term priorities may get in the way of maintaining the needed longer-term focus. In our paper, we discuss the diverging approaches of the EU (more holistic) and US (more fragmented) in setting longer-term policy objectives and their influence on the SDGs.

Second, the SDGs’ systems logic works through the interactions between SDGs, in which contributions to one SDG can advance progress on another SDG or target, but they can also undermine progress on other targets or goals. Tackling sustainable development challenges requires targeting the interactions between the SDGs rather than focusing on individual goals. A quick analysis issued by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in July 2020 shows both the impacts of the pandemic on many SDGs, and that the SDG framework can help map wider systemic effects of a crisis.

The main hurdle facing this logic is that SDGs that drive economic growth are given priority over SDGs aimed at social inclusion and environmental sustainability. It would be useful to pursue more targeted approaches that look into the net impacts of each type of economic activity.

Third, the SDGs feature a strategic logic. This works by actively involving private companies in sustainable development. Most major companies have responded supportively to the adoption of the Goals and begun to incorporate them in their operations and communications. Yet companies face a real hurdle in moving from intention to realization: they need to improve their impacts. Crossing this hurdle requires companies to integrate the SDGs into their entire organization, rather than positioning the goals in CSR or communications departments, and to measure and report on the results.

Outlook

Milton Friedman once famously said: “Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.”

In our paper, we argued that there are a number of interesting and relevant ideas constituting our SDG intelligence, that can help us move beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability and resilience. We only must avoid a parsimonious approach of focusing on separate elements of the 2030 Agenda at the expense of others, to ensure we do not throw away the child (the collective intelligence build-up) with the bathwater (crisis management).

Governments have long recognized the links between migration and development, but insufficient implementation may hinder progress on the SDGs. Analysis of the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) presented by governments in 2019 as part of their follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda suggests that migrants and refugees are at risk of being left behind.

A recent report by the UN’s Committee for Development Policy (CDP) highlights numerous gaps in SDG performance. It shows that foundational principles of the 2030 Agenda, such as the commitment to leave no one behind, lack practical examples of implementation. So too do responses to migration: only 26 of the 47 VNRs presented in 2019 show tangible policy action on migration, according to the CDP.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has shown migration being increasingly reflected in VNRs (at least 96% of VNRs in 2020 addressed the topic,[1] compared to 91% in 2019). However, the quality of references varies considerably. Some reviews provide in-depth analysis of migration patterns and the policy actions taken by governments to address its multiple dimensions, but others refer to the issue in passing, without citing any related policies or actions to enhance the impact of migration on development.

These analyses suggest that although governments continue to recognize the importance of migration to their development outcomes, many have still not integrated it effectively in their development plans and frameworks. IOM continues to encourage governments to do so. Its Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development provides a general framework for understanding why a whole-of-society and whole-of-community approach to migration is crucial to SDG achievement.

Recent UN reports and conferences have similarly called for more action on this front. In 2018 governments adopted the Global Compact for Migration, committing to “integrate migration into development planning and sectoral policies at the local, national, regional and global levels.” In 2020, the Secretary-General’s report on international migration and development emphasized whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to migration, “with a view to mainstreaming migration across all relevant policy domains ….”

Despite these concerns, several VNRs do present practical examples of how governments are addressing migration in their SDG implementation. For example, the Republic of Moldova’s VNR addresses the impacts of migration on human capital development, school attainment, de-skilling and remittances investment. The VNR process led to strong commitments by the government on protecting Moldovan migrant workers abroad, skills validation for returnees, and opportunities to invest in small and medium enterprises.

In Timor-Leste, the VNR has made it much easier for migration to be addressed in the UN’s principal development plans, and has created space for migration issues to be included in cross-sectoral development projects (for example, to mobilize diaspora financing for SDG implementation). At the national level, the country’s parliament has scheduled a session on migration, recognizing its importance to national development, and the role of migrants is now being considered in the government’s budget analysis for the first time.

These examples provide two key lessons for governments in the decade remaining to achieve the 2030 Agenda. First, migration must be mainstreamed more effectively into development plans and frameworks, in order to promote better development outcomes from migration. This requires more than just passing references in VNRs. More robust analysis and policy solutions must also be included. Improving data on migration is essential to this.

A second lesson from the country examples is on ensuring effective follow-up to the VNR itself. While producing VNRs is a crucial part of governments’ SDG monitoring efforts, it is not an end in itself. VNRs are intended to help identify both successes and areas where further action is needed. They provide an important platform – if utilized as such – to develop new policies, inform prioritization exercises, and focus resources and funding for accelerated SDG progress.

With only ten years left to meet the 2030 Agenda, turning commitments into tangible action is critical. Migration is one issue on which concerted effort is needed. Governments should look to the good examples that exist for ensuring planning and action to improve lives for migrants and leave no one behind.

Launched ahead of World Cities Day 2020, the publication highlights the importance of local leaders and city governments in implementing the SDGs, and notes that VLRs are gaining in momentum.

‘Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines on Voluntary Local Reviews’ was launched on 30 October 2020. The guidelines were developed by ESCAP and the Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanisation (PPSU) in partnership with cities in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand.

In the report’s foreword, Stefanos Fotiou, ESCAP, and Norliza Hashim, PPSU, explain that by pursuing sustainable urbanization, cities can be “change agents” and help solve the climate crisis, unsustainable resource use, widespread inequality, discrimination and injustice. This is particularly true of Asia-Pacific cities, where most of the world’s urban population lives. They add that most of the global SDG indicators have an urban dimension, and about one-third of SDG indicators are measured at the local rather than national level. Therefore, the authors write, “any country serious about [achieving the SDGs] will find the path to sustainable development runs through its cities.”

The report notes that VLRs can help cities and regions to: localize the SDGs; demonstrate their capacity and commitments; rethink their planning process; better engage local communities to understand their needs; and get communities involved meaningfully in recovery strategies and long-term development efforts.

However, no specific template or official format exists for VLRs. The publication provides the first region-specific guidance on how to conduct a VLR and produce a report.

The guidelines build on existing resources to provide practical tools, checklists, and templates for conducting a VLR. The resources are designed to be complimentary with the respective country’s Voluntary National Review (VNR). The publication includes an overview of the VLRs produced already by several Asia-Pacific municipalities, including: Hamamatsu, Japan, which reviewed all 17 SDGs and has incorporated them into its 30-year development plan; Kitakyushu, Japan, which includes a focus on pollution abatement; and Shimokawa, Japan, highlighting extensive stakeholder engagement.

Observing World Cities Day 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “local action is the key” to rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic and engaging in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. He said that the pandemic response has brought the value of communities “into sharp focus…. Let us maintain this recognition of their value.”

UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif said the only way to achieve the SDGs is to create wider opportunities for communities to “network, co-create and finance their initiatives.” She said the value of communities “goes far beyond supporting emergency responses…. communities must be at the centre of designing their own, longer term solutions.”

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

‘State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs‘, a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020 prepared by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES);

‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’ which provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation; and

‘Guidelines for Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs)’ in a VLR Series by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).

Two proponent groups of WTO members launched initiatives to deepen discussions on sustainable development at the Organization.

The Trade and Environment Week took place from 16-20 November. As we note in our preview, it included meetings of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), a high-level session on the role of trade in promoting an environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery from COVID-19, and a series of WTO member-led events and workshops, which explored “issues at the forefront of the trade and environment agenda,” showcased experiences in making global trade more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive, and exchanged ideas on what role trade and the WTO can play in “building back greener and better” from COVID-19.

The Week also featured two sessions organized by civil society. A panel convened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) brought together stakeholder perspectives on trade, environment, and sustainable development. An event organized by Geneva Trade Platform, the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Environment and Trade Hub, the Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Governance Centre, and Chatham House’s Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy sought to identify priority areas for the trade and environment debate at the WTO.

The Week’s discussions provided an important impetus to the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference.

The Week kicked off with a CTE meeting where the EU introduced its European Green Deal, describing it as “a decisive action” “to transform the EU’s economy for a sustainable future” while leaving no one behind. The EU highlighted efforts to introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism to manage the risk of “carbon leakage” to make up for situations where “climate action ambitions are not shared globally.” The EU is conducting assessments covering the measure’s various impacts and its legal feasibility in light of WTO rules, EU trade agreements, and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Canada, Colombia, India, Norway, Paraguay, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Turkey offered comments on the European Green Deal, with several, including the US, expressing concerns over the carbon tax. Members called for the EU to ensure its initiatives comply with WTO rules and bilateral and regional agreements, recognize the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), ensure costs are not solely born by producers, and maintain transparency in policy making, among other actions.

On 17 November, a group of WTO members launched “structured discussions on trade and environmental sustainability.” Its proponents intend “to collaborate, prioritize and advance discussions on trade and environmental sustainability” and involve interested WTO members and external stakeholders. The structured discussions will be based on a statement to the CTE by Australia, Canada, Chad, Chile, Costa Rica, the EU, the Gambia, Fiji, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, and the UK. It is supported by 49 members.

Another group of members launched an “open-ended informal dialogue” to promote a sustainable plastics economy. The informal dialogue aims to “explore how improved trade cooperation, within the rules and mechanisms of the WTO, could contribute to domestic, regional, and global efforts to reduce plastics pollution and transition to a more circular and environmentally sustainable global plastics economy.” Proponents of this process are Australia, Barbados, Canada, China, Fiji, Jamaica, and Morocco.

In addition, the SDG Knowledge Hub provided coverage of the following events convened during the WTO Trade and Environment Week:

The events sought to help inform the deliberations of the CTE, which reconvened on 20 November. Several members reported back on the events they had organized during the Trade and Environment Week. Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and CTE Chair, expressed confidence that the Week’s discussions provided “an important impetus” to the Committee’s work and the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12).

Other updates and presentations heard by the CTE covered, among other issues:

Ongoing discussions among Costa Rica, Fiji, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland relating to the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), which is now in its third round of talks;

The Glasgow Climate Change Conference scheduled to take place from 1-12 November 2021, with the UK pledging to accelerate progress towards reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement;

Environmentally friendly coffee growing in Colombia;

Sustainable mechanized production systems for agriculture in Paraguay;

Manufacture of paper from bio-waste in Sri Lanka; and

Members’ trade-related environmental measures as reflected in their 2019 Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) where the agriculture and energy sectors were found to have the highest number of such measures.

Her portfolio features a variety of homes in a number of master-planned communities throughout California, and she’s been a member of the SDG team for two decades.

For the last two years she’s focused on Mariner’s Cove, a 7.5-acre master-planned community in Vallejo. Construction of the 175 single-family homes and two parks will begin next year.

“Re-establishing and expanding Vallejo’s connection to the waterfront was a major objective of the project,” she said. “There’s going to be even more public access, park space and amenities for everyone to enjoy. We worked closely with Gates Associates on how our housing designs integrated with their landscape and urban plan, with more accessibility to the waterfront through paseos and trails. Through the project’s view corridors you can see sailboats and the waterfront from several vantage points.”

Mastro holds extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of home design, project entitlements and construction documentation. Her methodical approach ensures her work gets delivered on-time and within the set budget. She’s an advisor to SDG’s project teams, providing guidance and direction to all of the firm’s project managers. Her diligent project management skills allow for trusted and enduring relationships with every client she serves.

She earned her degree in architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and began her career as an intern with SDG Architects in 2000. Now she serves as a principal for the company, overseeing a plethora of projects related to residential design and development. Mastro also mentors up-and-coming designers through Professional Women in Building, a part of the Building Industry Association.

In this interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Mastro talks about her favorite projects, how she stays organized and what she enjoys most about her work.

Q: What are some of your favorite projects you’ve worked on?

A: I’ve designed a variety of housing types in Northern California, including a big new waterfront project in Vallejo for Callahan Development. It’s called Mariner’s Cove and features 175 single-family townhouses and a pair of parks on 7.5 acres near the waterfront. The homes take advantage of their location close to the waterfront and the greenspace corridors. Homes next to paseos have direct access for taking walks or going to the ferry. The homes have garage access via alleyways so you have a really pleasing front-door entry off of paseos and pedestrian oriented streets. We’ve also stepped-back the homes so that they don’t feel tall and imposing next to pedestrian areas.The floor plan layouts, the detailing inside and out, the materials, everything has been designed for modern tastes and needs while also reflecting Vallejo’s neighborhoods and styles. We think Mariners Cove will fit in well and provide much needed housing and recreation space for the community.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?

Details Jennifer Mastro, principal, SDG Architects. Mastro started with the firm as an intern in 2000 and became a principal in 2015. Her portfolio includes homes at the Wilder Ranch community in Orinda and SummerHill Homes development in Mountain View. Most recently she's worked on designs for Mariner's Cove, a 7.5-acre waterfront community of 175 homes in Vallejo which will begin construction next year. Located east of Mt. Diablo in Brentwood, SDG Architects' portfolio includes residential, mixed-use, hospitality and commercial projects. The firm prides itself on sustainable, LEED-certified designs and has more than two decades of experience in the fields of master planning, community development and urban design. See More Collapse

A: We do a lot of homes for developers throughout California. One of our recent projects was Wilder Ranch in Orinda where we designed custom homes for that project. I also helped with the design of three separate projects for SummerHill Homes in Mountain View. These projects are all a learning experience. When we can work with the city and the builders collaboratively we can achieve a high level of design. It can be a little frustrating to get through the process with each city because it’s a learning experience. I’ve found projects turn out nicely when they require a high level of design from our builders.

Q: What’s one of your favorite parts of your job?

A: I enjoy working with different builders, taking a project through entitlement and getting to know each city and what they’re looking for in terms of architectural articulation. I myself enjoy the day-to-day aspects such as entitlements, which is the process where a design goes through the planning department. I’m also very fond of laying the floor plan out. You think a lot about how the home will be used and design it so that it is most beneficial to its owner.

Q: How do you stay organized?

A: I work to keep good notes, and remembering what each city and client might want as their standard keeps me organized. Notes, either handwritten or on the computer, play a major role in staying on task. We’re working on developing more tech-based solutions to stay organized. We have a database with our contacts and project specs, and the technology side makes the information available to everyone, which is especially helpful when you’re not working on-site.

Q: Are there any trends are you noticing about contemporary architecture?

A: I see us thinking more about the way people are living. There’s a big shift towards homes having offices or tech centers or smaller rooms that can be closed off. This is because people are working more from home or have kids who are doing remote learning. That seems to be the design trend of the moment. We have redone floor plans for a lot of our builders, so this might be more of a permanent thing. The most important thing is to listen to the client and learn what they’re trying to achieve.","Energetic, stylish and thoughtful, Jennifer Mastro proves on a daily basis why she’s an integral member of SDG Architects.

This was the second of two civil society-led events of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade and Environment Week.

The event, which took place on 18 November, was organized by the Geneva Trade Platform, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Environment and Trade Hub, the Global Governance Centre at the Graduate Institute Geneva, and Chatham House’s Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy.

Coming just one day after a WTO member group launched “structured discussions” devoted to trade and environmental sustainability, the interventions largely built around what items could be raised in these talks, and what approach these could take.

Anja von Moltke, UNEP Environment and Trade Hub, opened the event by calling for “all hands on deck to push leadership and action for a sustainable future.” With event co-organizer Carolyn Deere Birkbeck, Global Governance Centre, Graduate Institute Geneva, she stressed that the new narrative on trade and environment “must be about looking at how to ensure trade policy is a central part of the toolkit” that governments use for achieving their sustainability objectives.

Carlos Vanderloo, Canadian Mission to the WTO, said global cooperation and the involvement of all stakeholders will be crucial for addressing sustainability imperatives. Several panelists echoed the need for collaboration, inclusiveness, and coherence.

Many speakers described the convening power of the WTO as a valuable strength in this agenda-setting process. They highlighted a range of policy priorities that governments should address together with other actors in the trade and environment arena, many of which were directed at the “triple threat” of biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution.

One of the recurring themes was the circular economy, with speakers like Vanessa Erogbogbo, International Trade Centre (ITC), noting the need to manage environmental trade-offs, while calling for a better understanding of the environmental impact profile of value chains.

Malena Sell, Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, described the circular economy as “the only way forward” in addressing the triple threat, as this approach “cuts to the heart of how we produce, consume, and trade.” Trade facilitation could be a tool for supporting the circular economy, said Aditi Sara Verghese, World Economic Forum (WEF).

Elisabeth Tuerk, UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), highlighted the issue of supply chains, referring to UNECE’s work on transparency and traceability. Åsa Persson, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), called for a better understanding of climate and sustainability risk in supply chains.

Speakers including Soledad Leal Campos, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), David Vivas Eugui, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Shardul Agrawala, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Rashid Kaukab, CUTS International Geneva, identified environmentally harmful subsidies as another crucial priority for a future trade and environment agenda. Kaukab noted that this does not only include fisheries subsidies, but also those directed at agriculture.

Several participants, including Lily Sommer, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), Posh Pandey, South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE), and Crispin Conroy, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), referred to the need for lowering barriers to trade in environmental goods and services. Conroy said in the business world, many are talking about progress in this area as a “must-have” moment.

Many participants said development considerations must be front and center in the new agenda on trade and environmental sustainability. For example, Sommer called for examining carbon border adjustment measures, which are being debated in many countries as a trade policy tool for tackling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to ensure that these do not undermine developing countries’ development priorities. Kaukab cautioned against a “carrot-and-stick” approach, and urged greater support for capacity building and other assistance for least developed countries (LDCs). Leal Campos stressed that the policy community must “place sustainable development at the heart of any initiative, not only at the multilateral level, but at all levels and by all actors.”

Jan Yves Remy, Shridath Ramphal Centre for International Trade Law, Policy and Services, University of West Indies, said we need a better understanding of countries’ vulnerability to shocks, such as climate change and pandemics. He called for a better metric for country needs than traditional measures, such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

Vicente Yu, Third World Network (TWN), highlighted the need for greater flexibility and special differential treatment for developing countries, and the value of agreeing on a “peace clause” for developing countries to protect them from legal disputes when they undertake environmental measures that impact trade.

Céline Charveriat, Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP), called for greening trade for a green recovery. She stressed the need to “go beyond plastic litter” to talk about waste prevention and the challenges inherent in the petrochemical sector.

Angela Francis, WWF UK, called for a closer look at food and farming, especially the environmental challenges linked to agricultural production and trade.

Manuel Ruiz, Peruvian Society for Environmental Law, urged exploring the relationship between biodiversity, intellectual property rights (IPRs), fair and equitable access and benefit-sharing, and the wider trade regime.

We are a decade away from the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, yet when they were set in 2015, very few people would have anticipated a global pandemic affecting almost every country and territory across the world in 2020. The predictions are dire, from the projected number of people who will die from the virus, to the impact on food security, livelihoods and markets, to the effect on the social fabric of many communities.

However, among the crisis and chaos, there is also a real opportunity to rebuild better following the pandemic, in a way that leaves vulnerable people and communities significantly better off than they were before.

Decent jobs must be top priority as “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic.

Business Fights Poverty has conducted extensive collaboration with businesses, organizations and individuals, and held online events in July and during the UN’s high-level week in September. Through these discussions we have identified five primary ways that businesses can help with the global effort to rebuild better.

1. Demonstrate a purpose beyond profit

There will be increasing demand from employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders for companies to more actively articulate and demonstrate their wider societal purpose beyond profits (recognizing that firms with purpose also do better financially). Such purpose should include tackling inequality, protecting human rights, supporting climate action and acknowledging their carbon footprint, and being better at, and more transparent about, measuring impact. Practical measures could include a company’s board of directors issuing a “Statement of Purpose” committing to bringing a positive return for their communities and stakeholders, not just shareholders.

2. Support the most vulnerable people and communities within value chains

The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing fragilities in global value chains. Such fragilities include micro, small, and medium enterprises without the cash reserves to endure the economic impact of lockdowns, and hourly workers without access to sick pay or social protection. We have produced an action toolkit, which is free to download from our website, looking at vulnerable workers whose health is at risk due to exposure to the virus, and those whose livelihoods are at risk because they depend on export sectors that have ground to a halt. Articles on tackling hidden labor and a video on enhancing social justice in global supply chains offer additional insight.

3. Invest in building new skills and personal resilience

COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive to the world of work and learning, accelerating trends towards automation and new technology. There is an urgent need for upskilling and reskilling workers – not only with technical skills, but also with the soft skills that are increasingly demanded by employers.

As “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic, decent jobs must be top priority. With support from The Lab at the International Labour Organization (ILO), Business Fights Poverty has created the Better Jobs Action Toolkit to provide guidance to businesses and organizations on ensuring that recovery efforts prioritize decent work.

We have also launched an innovative partnership with life sciences company Bayer, to explore how a wider uptake of “self-care” approaches can reduce pressure on health services, improve health incomes, and empower individuals and communities. Learn more through this online discussion.

4. Prioritize action on equity

The pandemic has affected people differently, based on their gender, race and income level. Women have been more exposed to infection as they make up the majority of front-line health workers. Women also are often in the most vulnerable positions in workforces and value chains, they have faced a surge in domestic violence, and they taken on the burden of unpaid care. At the same time, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery in the U.S. and the resulting protests have exposed deep-rooted, systemic racism and an urgent need for action.

Natalie Deacon of Avon writes that flexible, digital earning opportunities can support women’s well-being and avoid the rolling back of gender gains. On 3 December 2020, Business Fights Poverty will host a one-day online learning and collaborative event on gender equity in pandemic responses. Uwe Gneiting from Oxfam America also shares thoughts on how businesses can tackle inequalities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

5. Build system-level partnerships

COVID-19 has highlighted how truly interconnected we all are as well as the large-scale challenges we face, such as inequity and climate change. So, we need to rethink how we partner – shifting from traditional, transactional-style partnerships to ones that bring together multiple partners from across a company’s value chain, among peer groups, with government and civil society. With Seth Green, founding director of the Baumhart Center, an interdisciplinary center at Loyola University Chicago that prepares leaders to tackle society’s most pressing challenges, we created a “How To” video for companies on how to partner for transformational change.

The global pandemic is far from over and the consequences will be felt for many years to come. Business Fights Poverty will continue to play a key role in helping businesses to respond to threats, build trust, and connect partners for purposeful collaboration. It’s crucial that we leverage the learnings and changes brought on by COVID-19 to forge ahead into the Decade of Action to improve millions of lives by 2030.

Soledad Leal Campos, Senior Policy Advisor, IISD, moderated the session.

Noting the “long history” of the trade and environment debate, Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Executive Director, IISD Europe, noted that today’s consumers are increasingly interested in the environmental impact of their purchasing choices. She said the environmental and economic challenges of our time demand policy responses whose impacts extend “beyond the border,” requiring a closer look at trade policy and disciplines. Bernasconi-Osterwalder called for an open, creative, solutions-oriented, and inclusive discussion on environmental and trade policy issues, including implications for developing countries.

Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and Chair of the WTO’s Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), welcomed the discussion as “critical and timely,” and stressed the value of a strong contribution from civil society. He noted that stakeholder events “can plant the seed of constructive communication and new approaches to complex trade and environment issues.”

Blackman noted WTO members’ more active participation in the CTE’s discussions, which have become more substantive in recent years. Among the topics raised by some WTO members at the CTE, he highlighted the circular economy and role of trade policy to overcome obstacles in value chains, and the removal of environmentally harmful distortions, including fossil fuel subsidies.

Development remains the overarching objective of developing and least developed countries, and trade is a means to achieve that.

Peter Wooders, Senior Director, Energy, IISD, reported on key takeaways from the sustainability pillar of Geneva Trade Week, including the need for greater international cooperation across all levels. He highlighted an IISD-organized high-level plenary as an example of the wide scope of what sustainability encompasses, with speakers hailing from the fields of biodiversity, public health, agriculture and trade, labor, fisheries and environment, and climate change.

Rashid Kaukab, Executive Director, CUTS International, Geneva, said that looking ahead, considering context issues and ensuring harmony across the various parts of the global governance architecture will be essential. “Development remains the overarching objective of developing and least developed countries, and trade is a means to achieve that,” he noted.

Kaukab said the understanding of the term “sustainable development” can vary significantly across stakeholders, and called for a “thoughtful, calibrated, and inclusive approach.” Among “win-win” scenarios for growth, development, environment, and trade, he mentioned disciplining harmful fisheries subsidies, reaching a deal that reforms domestic agricultural support, revisiting the relationship between biodiversity frameworks and intellectual property rules, and addressing trade in plastic waste.

Isabel Jarrett, Manager, Pew Charitable Trusts’ Program on Reducing Harmful Fisheries Subsidies, noted that WTO members have two political mandates to reach a deal this year: the 2020 deadline included in SDG target 14.6 and the decision from the WTO’s Buenos Aires Ministerial Conference in 2017 to conclude an accord before the next ministerial gathering.

She said while “we have more data on the damage we are wreaking on our oceans and the need to act,” subsidies for boat construction or fuel can lower the cost of fishing and incentivize more fishing than what our marine resources can bear. Jarrett highlighted a policy statement signed by 174 civil society organizations from around the world supporting a deal in 2020, known by the hashtag #StopFundingOverfishing.

Carolyn Deere Birkbeck, Senior Researcher, Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Governance Centre, called for a “new narrative on trade and environment” that is both responsive to immediate crises and forward-looking. She said this agenda must address developing countries’ challenges and priorities, especially given that COVID-19 has complicated efforts towards achieving the SDGs and ensuring a just transition.

Deere Birkbeck stressed the need to align trade, environment, and the SDGs at the national level, including when considering the impact of trade policy abroad. At the international level, she said the WTO can play a greater role by promoting dialogue, information sharing, and capacity building.

The briefing focused on two recent reports from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Presentations included remarks from the UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, a role established 25 years ago due to growing concern about the dumping in Africa of hazardous waste generated in Europe.

Held on 20 October 2020, the briefing provided an opportunity to discuss: a report on issues of concern, detailing eight emerging policy issues and other issues of concern identified under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), and reviewing how regulatory and policy frameworks address them; and a report on strengthening the science-policy interface for chemicals and waste management, which assesses three options for such an interface: an independent platform; institutionalizing outlook development processes; and thematic subsidiary panels with specialized task forces. UNEP developed the reports in response to requests by the fourth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) for consideration at UNEA-5.

Marcos Orellana, UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, said the science-policy interface is particularly important regarding human rights implications of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. He said the “right to science” in the human rights field is anchored in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

He said criteria for a successful SPI in this area include credibility and independence, as well as transparency to prevent conflict of interest. He also highlighted the private sector’s role in the work of existing science-policy platforms in chemicals and waste, as well as the need to protect against inappropriate corporate influence. Orellana said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): preserves the integrity of the scientific debate; keeps discussions transparent; and enables access to the scientific evidences in which the assessments are based.

In response to questions from participants, Orellana also discussed disclosure of information by manufacturers. He highlighted: the complexity of balancing the benefits of scientific progress with intellectual property rights (IPRs); the need for governments to establish regulatory mechanisms to ensure access to information; and risks that platforms may be captured by special interests.

Felix Wertli, Switzerland, said the most effective SPI option for Switzerland is an intergovernmental panel, which would best prevent conflicts of interest and ensure scientific integrity. Speakers also pointed out that:

The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS) have embedded SPI mechanisms, such as the POPs Review Committee under the Stockholm Convention, and expert working groups, for example on plastic and on e-waste, under the Basel Convention;

Digital tools are important to maximize the impact of SPI platforms; and

Virtual working groups have been established during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure discussions continue on the post-2020 framework for chemicals and waste management.

Discussions also addressed the current model of the Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO), adopted at UNEA, and its deficiencies regarding strengthening the SPI.

Participants raised the need to strike a balance in the post-2020 instrument, including regarding funding, between the high-level, research/policy-oriented aspects and on-the-ground efforts on issues of concern. Exchanges also touched on technology transfer and institutional strengthening in developing countries, including through UNEP’s Special Programme on Institutional Strengthening for the Chemicals Cluster, which helps developing countries access funding and develop sound plans for managing chemicals and waste.

Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C scenario.

The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.

There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.

Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.

A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.

“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”

The Protocol is available for comment for one month, from 13 October till 13 November.

Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, launched by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020.

Part of a joint series on trade and sustainability, the 10 November webinar focused on the theme, ‘Voluntary Sustainability Standards, Public Procurement, and Trade Policy: Trends, Challenges, and Development Implications.’ Participants also discussed the implications of integrating such standards into trade policy, in particular for developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs).

Cristina Larrea, Lead, Sustainability Standards, IISD, moderated the discussion. She said the webinar built on a report titled, ‘Scaling up VSS through Sustainable Public Procurement and Trade Policy,’ produced by the UN Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS), in collaboration with the University of Leuven (Belgium).

Larrea defined VSS as initiatives that support industry actors in making informed decisions to advance sustainability, and highlighted that while not mandatory, VSS can act as de facto requirements. She noted that according to IISD’s Global Market Report, VSS-compliant production in commodities such as cocoa, cotton, coffee, and palm oil, grew between 2008-2018, reaching an estimated 20-30% of total production volume.

Santiago Fernandez de Cordoba, UNFSS, outlined the role of VSS as a tool to transform the way we are producing, consuming, and trading. He said UNFSS aims to harness VSS’ potential to achieve the SDGs by: facilitating developing countries’ access to global markets, stimulating well-informed dialogue among stakeholders, and elevating capacities for producers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and exporters who can be marginalized by VSS in global trade.

De Cordoba highlighted five proposals to integrate VSS into public policy:

Enhance national capacity;

Incorporate VSS within the trade regime by using the Standard International Trade Classification;

Avoid proliferation of VSS systems through mutual recognition mechanisms;

Curb over-certification; and

Conduct policy dialogue on the benefits of scaling up VSS.

Axel Marx, University of Leuven, highlighted the role of governments in facilitating the adoption and use of VSS through sustainable public procurement (SPP) to drive sustainable development. He recommended that in their efforts to integrate VSS in SPP, government buyers prioritize credible VSS over non-credible ones. Marx pointed to the emergence of VSS references in free trade agreements (FTAs), and said governments could use VSS as a conditionality in market regulation and export promotion.

Liesbeth Casier, Policy Advisor, IISD, said in order to ensure that VSS deliver on their full potential for SPP, it is important to address implementation, procurement agencies’ ability to determine what is sustainable, and compliance verification, among other issues. She underscored the need to ensure that “sustainability does not become a burden” and that public policy for VSS does not “crowd out” SMEs, which are crucial for job creation. Casier said governments can take complementary actions to ensure that SMEs have access to the SPP market by using e-procurement systems and introducing quotas for contracts to be awarded to SMEs, among other actions.

Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Senior Director, Economic Law and Policy, IISD, highlighted that while “trade and environment discussions are picking up again,” including in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and FTAs increasingly incorporate environmental provisions, few contain references to VSS. She highlighted the planned Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), where VSS encourage the promotion and application of ecolabels that are transparent in their criteria and meaningful for consumers. Bernasconi-Osterwalder warned that costly labeling and certification measures may cause developing country producers to lose market access, and recommended that countries undertake ex ante impact assessments of FTAs.

Responding to questions from the audience, participants discussed regulatory versus non-regulatory aspects of VSS, the benefits of mutual recognition between VSS, the need for multiple VSS labels to prevent monopolies, and the role of complementary policies in ensuring that VSS do not marginalize developing countries and SMEs.

In closing, Makane Moïse Mbengue, Professor of International Law, University of Geneva, stressed the importance of cooperation on enhancing developing countries’ capacities to ensure that VSS help them achieve the SDGs.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all countries at the United Nations, provide a set of objectives and targets that can serve as a blueprint to “build back better” after the pandemic.

This week, a report card is being released on Australia’s progress toward achieving these goals. It also highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on our ability to meet our SDG targets by 2030.

The report shows Australia is performing well in health and education, but failing in climate, environment and areas linked to social inequality.

The good news is that trust in government has risen significantly since the pandemic began, no doubt reflecting in part Australia’s relatively good response to the crisis.

Australians are proud of what we have been able to achieve, and this trust and optimism will be needed as we try to tackle some of the stubborn challenges highlighted in the report.

Why targets are critical

In adopting the SDGs, all countries (including Australia) recognised the need to take a long-term and integrated approach to national planning informed by data and evidence.

Central to this approach is the setting of economic, social and environmental targets for 2030, which help to provide clear signposts for where we want to go.

Targets are critical. They set the priorities and level of ambition, encourage a shift from short to long-term thinking, provide investment certainty, and mobilise people to collaborate to solve problems.

They also enable a clear picture of where we are on track or off track, and the scale and pace of change needed.

Read more: Australia falls further in rankings on progress towards UN Sustainable Development Goals

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, Australia still lacks national targets for many of the specific goals, and this is undermining our ability to plan effectively for our future.

The report card makes three important contributions:

1) It proposes an initial set of 2030 targets for Australia across economic, social and environmental indicators.

2) It assesses Australia’s progress towards these targets over the past two decades, highlighting where we are falling behind and where accelerated action is needed.

3) It evaluates the effects of COVID-19 on Australia’s capacity to achieve the SDGs.

Where Australia is falling behind

Our key findings in this week’s report show where Australia needs to focus its energies to meet our SDGs.

Social challenges

Australians are living longer, but are more obese and, since the pandemic, drinking more alcohol.

Domestic violence has increased during COVID-19.

Homicide rates have halved since 2000, yet the prison population has increased by 32% since 2006, with Indigenous Australians vastly over-represented.

Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, experiencing more psychological distress and a greater chance of job disruption.

Environmental challenges

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined only marginally since 2000, and little progress has been made since 2013. Australia is not on track to meet a 2030 emissions target consistent with the Paris Agreement objective to keep global warming to well below 2°C.

Australia’s per-capita material footprint is one of the highest in the world – more than 70% above the OECD average – and rising.

Hard coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef has declined, and the number of species now threatened has increased since 2000.

Economic challenges

Women, young people and those without high school qualifications are more likely to have had their employment disrupted by COVID-19.

Australia’s relatively low levels of government debt will help in the COVID-19 recovery, yet household debt is well above the OECD average.

Wealth inequality is getting worse, with the share of household net worth of the bottom 40% of the population declining by 30% since 2004.

Since 2012, middle-class wages and incomes have stalled.

COVID-19 has stymied trade, foreign investment and skilled migration, prompting the need for new drivers of growth.

An opportunity for major policy changes

This report comes at a pivotal moment. All countries are facing a series of complex and related crises – a global health emergency, climate change, growing inequality, unemployment and biodiversity decline.

COVID-19 has reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but emissions are now returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.

And increased public deficits and debt may constrain governments’ abilities to address social and environmental challenges in the coming decade.

Read more: Why more housing stimulus will be needed to sustain recovery

On the other hand, COVID-19 has given governments the chance to undertake much more significant interventions than previously thought possible.

Australia has a huge opportunity to design a recovery strategy that strengthens our resilience to future shocks, addresses many of the challenges of sustainable development that we have not properly dealt with, and ensures the country’s long-term, sustainable prosperity.

The future vitality of the world’s forests, and the globally significant environmental services they provide, are increasingly under threat from human activities. Deforestation and forest degradation have negative impacts on biodiversity and hydrological services, and contribute to climate change.

Current Global Framework for Forest Loss

Global forest loss is addressed under a range of international agreements and conventions, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has specific provisions for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries).

In 2007, the international community recognized the importance of forests and land use as a key area for climate change mitigation when the Bali Action Plan called for policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries. In the wake of this important milestone, the year 2008 saw the launch of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and the UN-REDD Programme, under which countries work through a readiness process towards participation in REDD+. At the 2013 UN Climate Change Conference, countries approved the Warsaw Framework, which detailed the requirements for country participation in REDD+, notably including the requirements for forest reference (emission) level submissions, the benchmarks for assessing each country’s REDD+ performance.

Results of Countries’ REDD+ Efforts

Since the Warsaw Climate Change Conference in 2013, countries have made tremendous progress in preparing for, implementing, and reporting on their REDD+ actions. An FAO publication launched on 28 October 2020, titled From reference levels to results reporting: REDD+ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – 2020 update, provides an update of the results achieved so far. Let’s take a closer look at progress as of September 2020.

Fifty countries submitted 60 FREL/FRLs to the UNFCCC for technical assessment. These forest reference (emission) level (FREL/FRL) submissions collectively cover a forest area of approximately 1.35 billion ha (33% of global forest area).The countries that submitted a REDD+ FREL/FRL to the UNFCCC are responsible for around 75% of global deforestation (according to FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment). In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL.

In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL. Thirteen countries reported REDD+ results to the UNFCCC through 17 results submissions (in the REDD+ technical annex of their biennial update reports). Results have been reported for all REDD+ activities, although no single country covered all REDD+ activities. The majority of all reported results came from reducing emissions from deforestation (98%). The combined REDD+ results reported total 9.03 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil.

Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil. The UNFCCC published 45 FREL/FRL technical assessment reports, and 14 technical analysis reports of REDD+ results. For 43 of the 45 finalized technical assessments (96%), countries had submitted a modified FREL/FRL, and 33 of these 43 modified FREL/FRL submissions (77%) changed the FREL/FRL value as a result of the technical assessment. The reporting process triggers methodological improvements that help countries move towards more robust sample-based approaches. With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency.

With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency. Finally, six funding proposals for REDD+ results-based payments were approved by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The fund approved results-based payment proposals from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Paraguay totaling USD 361 million.

The most frequently mentioned objective in reference level submissions is to gain access to results-based finance. In 2017, the GCF launched the pilot program for results-based payment with a total envelope of USD 500 million.

To date, six countries have been awarded results-based payments, with two more countries (Argentina and Costa Rica) planning to present their proposals at the GCF board meeting in November 2020.

Moving Forward Amid COVID-19

Building on the considerable amount of work on REDD+ over the past decade, significant progress has been observed in recent years. Initiatives like UN-REDD Programme, the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) have played important roles.

However, with the unexpected challenges that 2020 has brought us, we need to ensure that we stay on track. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, moving REDD+ forward will be more important than ever, as the pandemic may result in even greater pressure on forest resources. REDD+ actions are here not only to avoid potential negative post-COVID realities, they are here to prevent similar catastrophes. The pandemic sweeping across the world is a crisis in which human activities have played a key role. It is up to us to ensure that it does not further negatively impact our planet.

We also need to work with countries to ensure that forest monitoring efforts result in quality forest data, which can drive higher ambitions for forests and the climate. This is fundamental to ensure the integrity of the REDD+ process and for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

edie's latest SDG Spotlight report, produced in association with Bryt Energy, looks at how businesses and national policies can transform operations, services, supply chains and strategies to help deliver Goal 7: Clean and Affordable Energy.

With less than 10 years to meet the SDGs, action is still not happening at the speed or scale required - despite a groundswell of ambition and action from organisations of all sectors and sizes.

edie's SDG Spotlight reports map out exactly how the business community can collectively achieve the SDGs through the scope of individual goals. Up next in this renewed series, we take a look at SDG 7 and ask: How can industry position clean and affordable energy as drivers of economic growth and decarbonisation across the globe?

Although global progress towards the UN's SDGs remains insufficient to meet the 2030 deadline, the UK is among the nations leading the way on alignment and, as such, is a prime market for impact investment.

The analysis, from Refinitiv, saw the UK receiving top marks for SDGs 2: Zero Hunger; 3: Good Health & Wellbeing; 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and 7: Affordable and clean energy.

Additionally, three-quarters of British firms believe they have a role to play in furthering national and international progress against the SDGs.

This new report features a current state of play on the SDG 7 and the global shift to clean energy and features a foreword from the REA's chief executive Dr Nina Skorupska on how clean energy can be at the heart of a green industrial revolution.

“Never before has our world needed a sustainable, affordable energy strategy for the future as now, with Covid-19 continuing to show just how vulnerable our precious, connected planet can be,” Skorupska said in the report.

“We must waste no time in forging a green economic recovery that will be sufficiently durable to meet the fast-evolving needs of today, whilst lasting enough to avoid compromising those of future generations.”

Bryt Energy's sales and marketing director David Taylor is also on hand in the report, outlining how new innovations are transforming the energy sector to the benefit of society.

309,https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/323894/world-risk-poll-provides-compass-sdg-road-map.aspx,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gallup Poll,World Risk Poll Provides a Compass for the SDG Road Map,"The 17 goals that make up the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) build on the earlier success of the Millennium Development Goals and provide a framework for policymakers and others to use to focus global development ambitions. The 169 targets and 231 unique indicators that quantify each of the 17 goals provide a multidimensional lens to view the development challenges that each of the goals tackles.

The SDG indicators are extensive, but the indicators themselves do not have a hierarchy. This makes it challenging for policymakers to determine what needs to be prioritized. The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas the following open-ended question: ""In your own words, what is the greatest source of RISK TO YOUR SAFETY in your daily life?""

With road-related hazards topping the list, the World Risk Poll data clearly highlight the significance of SDG 11.2: ""By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety.""

Bar chart. In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas to name their biggest source of risk in their lives. Road-related injuries were mentioned most often.

Despite some of the successes of the World Health Organization's decade of action for road safety, road traffic injuries are still the leading cause of death among young people aged 5 to 29. The World Risk Poll reinforces calls for a second decade of action, to double down on activities to address this self-identified greatest global risk.

Although road safety is the most frequently given response to the ""greatest risk"" question, residents of countries that have the lowest numbers of road traffic fatality rates per hundred thousand are those most likely to report road safety as the greatest issue.

Bar chart. Percentage worldwide who name road-related hazards as the top risk to their daily lives, according to country income group and traffic fatality rates.

The individual country-level data provide insights into what underpins this apparent contradiction. Madagascar, the country with the lowest levels of road safety reported as the ""greatest risk,"" has 28.6 deaths attributable to road safety per 100,000, about six times greater than Finland, which -- at 4.7 per 100,000 -- is the country with the highest levels of road safety reported as the largest risk.

The prevalence of more-pressing risks to daily life in lower-income countries such as Madagascar helps explain why people in lower-income countries and territories were less likely to mention road-related risks than people in higher-income countries. People living in low-income economies often face extreme poverty, poor infrastructure and weak public services, all of which form relatively more immediate threats to safety in daily life than road- and traffic-related risks.

Therefore, these threats may overshadow road-related risks despite the statistics that show how many people are injured in road accidents. This is true in Madagascar, where crime and violence are the single-largest risks, with 30% of Malagasy mentioning them.

With 12% of people worldwide mentioning crime, violence or terrorism as their top risk, people in Madagascar are hardly alone in their concerns. It also illustrates why achieving SDG target 16.1, to ""significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere"" is so crucial, and why leaders need a laser focus on indicator 16.1.4 -- the proportion of the population that feels safe walking alone at night where they live.

Based on World Poll data that measure indicator 16.1.4, while Malagasy in 2019 were not the least likely in the world to say they feel safe walking alone at night where they live, they did rank 133rd out of 144 countries on this measure.

Implications

The United Nations' most recent progress report on its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 maintains that, ""conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice"" remain threats to sustainable development. These threats have only been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, further jeopardizing the world's admittedly slow progress toward achieving ""peaceful and inclusive"" societies.

If the SDGs are designed to be a road map to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030, the World Risk Poll provides a complementary compass of how to navigate safely toward that destination.","The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

The Council discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tropical forests and timber, and debated whether to extend the treaty that governs the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).

As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the Council session opened with the preliminary findings of an ITTO study on the impacts of the pandemic on the tropical forest sector and the tropical timber industry. The report notes that the entire timber and forest products sector was affected by severe drops in consumption, production, employment, and trade, but tropical timber and products were hit even harder.

“Many enterprises are failing, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and unemployment, rising poverty, and reverse migration (from urban to rural) is putting new pressure on forests and their resources. Supply chains have been disrupted, and the resulting changes may completely reshape supply and value chains in the post-pandemic period. The bottom line, suggests the ITTO study, is that tropical timber may not recover until 2026,” according to ENB. One delegation noted the need for strong ITTO leadership over the next 12-24 months.

The Council also debated whether to extend the 2006 treaty that governs the ITTO, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006, which is due to expire in December 2021. The treaty expires on 7 December 2021 unless the Council decides to extend, renegotiate, or terminate it.

ENB reports that delegates who spoke indicated support for extending the Agreement for another five years, but some Member States said they would need time to complete domestic and legal consultations before they could formally agree on such a decision. This decision was postponed until ITTC-57, which will meet just before the deadline for the treaty to expire.

The Council also adopted the ITTO Biennial Work Programme for 2021-2022, and decisions on:

the next phase of the ITTO’s New Financing Architecture, instituting a programmatic approach to financing and streamlined project cycle;

the extension of the current ITTO Strategic Action Plan (SAP) through 2021 so the ITTO Secretariat can prepare and present a new draft SAP; and

the selection of the next ITTO Executive Director.

The Council Chair said the adoption of five key decisions during the meeting was due to rebuilt trust between the caucuses and a restored “sense of family” within the ITTO. As reported by ENB, the pledging of USD 3.5 million during ITTC-56, “most of it from ITTO’s traditionally largest donor, Japan, that had withheld donations in the wake of ITTO’s financial impairment scandal, plus the news that some USD 40 million may be forthcoming soon from various pending funding proposals, helped buttress this sense that ITTO is slowly but steadily making its comeback.”

The Council agreed to convene its next session from 2-7 November 2021 in the ITTO host city, Yokohama, Japan.

Meeting participants also flagged the recent joint communication by Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, and the US, which urges all WTO members to advance implementation of the TFA in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The communication points to the TFA’s implementation as already resulting in improved customs efficiency and transparency, and commits to accelerated actions in areas of, inter alia, pre-arrival processing, expedited shipments and border agency cooperation.

In a joint declaration the Banks pledge to align financing decisions with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The Summit took place virtually from 9-12 November 2020. It was organized by the Government of France in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will be marked in December 2020. It was also envisioned as a key milestone ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26), the UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), and the Generation Equality Forum.

The organizers noted that public development banks provide the funding for large infrastructure projects in the energy sector, among others, and are key for redirecting finance from projects that rely on fossil fuels to lower-carbon projects. Public development banks make 10% of all global investments from public and private sources.

The banks issued a joint declaration pledging to increase their focus on the climate emergency. The signatories “commit to align our activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to reach zero net emissions as early as possible. The Banks also “will mainstream resilience and adaptation in our strategies and operations and enhance action to fund the definition and implementation of national adaptation plans. We will help redirect private financial flows in support of low-carbon and climate-resilient sustainable development.”

Pledges also address: the energy transition; biodiversity, oceans, and nature; health; gender equality; digitalization; and leaving no one behind. The declaration highlights the need for a “global framework for SDG-compatible finance.” Further on SDG financing, it supports the convergence of practices towards “core standards” set out in the 2018 report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance. The declaration cites instruments to shift more investment to sustainable assets, such as by using a shadow price of carbon and providing information on SDG reporting.

The declaration ends with a section on “the road ahead,” which notes that the second Finance in Common meeting will be convened in 2021 to take stock of the first initiatives and set up a method for monitoring progress on the declaration.

Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP), said that building on the pledge, the governments that fund each public development bank must ensure their mandates tie lending practices to lower emissions.

Before the Summit, a group of European development banks issued a separate pledge to phase out fossil fuel investments, and said they will work towards a stronger position on investment in coal in time for COP 26.

In an attempt to capture some progress and further focus the negotiations, the Chair of the WTO negotiating group in charge of fisheries talks, Ambassador Wills of Colombia, introduced a revised version of the draft consolidated text he had initially circulated to WTO Members in July. The text, however, was not discussed in detail by negotiators.

Delegations also considered a range of pending issues to narrow down differences, including: the duration of a possible subsidy prohibition for actors engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; unassessed stocks; dispute settlement and remedies; and special and differential treatment for developing countries. Gaps between WTO members’ positions, however, remain significant on a number of key topics.

A number of new proposals were also presented last week. These include a proposal from the Philippines on dispute settlement in cases where territoriality is disputed; a “discussion text” from Chinese Taipei on dispute settlement procedures; and a proposal from four landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) – Afghanistan, Mongolia, Nepal, and Paraguay – concerning transit transportation of fish and technical assistance. A new proposal by Brazil proposing quantitative limits to the total amounts of subsides WTO member would be allowed to disburse was discussed intersessionally between the two last meeting clusters.

While progress has been achieved in negotiations in recent months, delegates and observers alike warn that clinching a deal by the talks’ 2020 deadline enshrined in SDG target 14.6 will require a quick and significant intensification of negotiations. Last week, a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) launched a global campaign titled, ‘Stop Funding Overfishing,’ to support the conclusion of a meaningful WTO agreement by the end of the year. The campaign’s policy statement, which has been signed by 169 organizations from around the world, including leading environmental NGOs, such as WWF, Greenpeace, Oceana, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), calls on governments around the world to “fulfil their commitment to curb the public money that supports overfishing and degrades our ocean.”

The last meeting cluster of 2020 is planned for the week starting on 30 November.

A Step Forward

The revised draft consolidated text presented last week updates the first version of the draft consolidated text presented by the negotiations’ Chair on 25 June 2020. All WTO members accepted this text as a basis for further discussion, a step that was widely perceived as a significant sign of progress. For the first time in more than a decade, negotiators are focusing on one single negotiating document and proposing amendments to it based on common concepts.

Most key delegations have also reportedly started to think in terms of possible options for compromise and flexibilities. While this has not led to tangible headway in terms of substance yet, this change of dynamics is perceived as a necessary step towards concluding a deal.

The revised draft consolidated text presented by the Chair last week is an attempt to move in that direction. It contains a number of revisions of varying degrees of importance as well as a number of additions, in particular to replace some of the placeholders that were included in the first version of the text.

“I am confident that all delegations will find things to like in the changes that I am proposing, and that this revision thus will represent a step forward in the evolution of our work toward that full consensus,” the Chair said when introducing the document, according to the WTO Secretariat.

What’s in the Revised Draft Consolidated Text?

In essence, WTO negotiators are currently considering new subsidy disciplines in three substantive areas: (1) subsides to IUU fishing; (2) subsidies to the fishing of stocks that are already in an overfished condition; and (3) subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity more broadly.

No major changes were introduced in the new text regarding the rules related to IUU fishing and overfished stocks. In the case of IUU fishing, the most notable revision is simplification of the language that describes the conditions a determination of IUU fishing would have to meet in order to trigger a prohibition to subsidise a vessel or operator. The revised text states that an IUU finding would need to be based on positive evidence and follow due process, without specifying the steps required.

The most significant modification concerns the possible qualitative prohibition of subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. The previous version of the text stated that subsidies that reduce the operating costs and capital costs of fishing would be prohibited in specific situations where fishing capacity or effort is excessive. The revised text simply lists a number of subsidy types that would be prohibited, including subsidies for fuel, boat construction and modernization, or price support.

This simplification increases the potential reach of the prohibition, but is closely linked to another change made to an exception to this rule. To benefit from this revised exception and continue to provide subsidies, WTO members would need to show that they implement measures to maintain relevant stocks at sustainable levels. The revised exception drops the requirement that such fisheries management measures be effective, meaning that it would likely be easier for members to invoke the exception to continue to subsidize fishing.

In order to clarify which marine species the proposed agreement would apply to, the revised text also introduces a definition of “fish,” which, like other key definitions, has been taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures. This constitutes an attempt by the Chair to move forward on an issue some members feel required a disproportionate amount of time during the previous meeting cluster in October.

The Chair also proposed new text to replace three placeholders relating to: transparency and notification requirements, with specific information to be notified still to be defined; institutional arrangements; and dispute settlement.

Finally, the revised Chair’s text includes a new exception for subsidies for disaster relief – a general idea around which there seemed to be convergence during the October meeting cluster – under certain conditions.

Quick Intensification Needed to Meet 2020 Deadline

Despite positive signs in the dynamics of fisheries talks in recent months, significant efforts will be needed from delegations to overcome their differences on various parts of the disciplines. Recent work by IISD highlights that a number of important decisions will need to be made by WTO members in order to successfully reach an agreement.

One of the key questions for negotiators relates to the issue of special and differential treatment (S&D) for developing countries, a notoriously sensitive topic in the context of WTO negotiations. The topic is underlined in the negotiations’ mandate and in SDG target 14.6, which specifies that “appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.”

Last week’s cluster of meetings highlighted the divergence of views on this topic. Ambassador Didier Chambovey of Switzerland, recently appointed “Friend of the Chair” to facilitate S&D discussions, said members’ positions remain “quite far apart.”

While some members would like S&D provisions to exempt developing countries from parts of the main subsidy prohibitions, others think that new disciplines should instead provide only for transition periods and technical assistance for implementation. Ambassador Chambovey called on delegations to be pragmatic, creative, and flexible to find acceptable solutions that could gather consensus.

With only weeks before the start of the last meeting cluster on fisheries subsidies in 2020, S&D is only one of the numerous questions still outstanding in WTO fisheries talks. To be able to clinch a deal by the 2020 deadline, WTO members will need to intensify efforts in the coming weeks and to demonstrate they have the political will to reach compromise on these various issues.

Gaps between WTO members’ positions, however, remain significant on a number of key topics.
To benefit from this revised exception and continue to provide subsidies, WTO members would need to show that they implement measures to maintain relevant stocks at sustainable levels.

These IOAs are in six critical SDG (sustainable development goals) enabling sectors that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development, the UNDP, which works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities through the sustainable development of nations, said in a release.

""India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally. This initiative is an instrumental stride in India''s development trajectory, and I believe it couldn''t have come at a better time. We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India,"" Invest India MD & CEO Deepak Bagla said.

The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said.

It is thus critical to ensure that these pathways are sustainable, resilient and equitable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SDG financing gap has widened by an estimated USD 400 billion in developing countries, adding to the pre-COVID shortfall of USD 2-2.5 trillion per annum, it said.

Whilst the government continues to show strong support for the SDGs and a sustainable recovery, mobilizing this kind of capital and supporting the on-ground innovation needed to meet the SDG targets by 2030, requires the collective efforts of the public and private sector transition from short-term recovery to long-term sustainability, said the release.

The 6 SDG-enabling sectors include education, healthcare, agriculture & allied activities, financial services, renewable energy & alternatives and sustainable environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

This ensured that the Map''s findings were truly reflective of market sentiment, the UNDP said.

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust private equity and venture capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability.

The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors, said the UN development agency.

The UNDP said nearly 50 per cent of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs (internal rate of return) in excess of 20 per cent. While 84 per cent of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Invest India on Friday launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 investment opportunities areas (IOAs).

The first of its kind, the webinar focused on the theme, ‘The Future of Trade and Environment: Interactions with Geneva’s Youth.’

The event was held in the context of the WTO Trade and Environment Week. Gergana Kiskinova and Romain Williams, WTO, moderated the discussion.

The event began with opening remarks from two ambassadors, who provided background to the event and shared perspectives on the role of young people in international discussions taking place in Geneva.

Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and Chair of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), stated that the current generation of young people will face major environmental challenges. Emphasizing challenges posed by unsustainable consumption patterns and single-use plastics, he urged young people to decide what kind of future they want and look at how they can both create and protect it. Blackman encouraged all schools in Geneva to be champions of environment and sustainability to enable Geneva’s young people to become world leaders in climate change awareness and plastic-free zones.

Bettina Waldmann, Ambassador of Germany to the WTO, recognized that this generation is “very much aware of the ecological challenges we face.” She highlighted the importance of greater engagement among trade diplomats and youth. Recognizing that global trade has an impact on our ecological system, Waldmann said the WTO “can and will be” part of the solution. She further noted the EU Plastics Strategy, which addresses plastic pollution, covering the material’s entire lifecycle.

Students from the German School of Geneva gave a presentation on the problem of plastic waste, using Barbados as an example for Europe to follow. They outlined how Barbados gradually phased out single-use plastics over time rather than introducing a complete ban overnight. The students called for efforts to halve plastic waste by 2050, and mentioned plant starch as an alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics.

Students from Institut Florimont delivered a presentation on trade in goods and the role of clean transport. While global trade in goods is made possible by multiple forms of transport, they said freight is responsible for 7% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Among solutions, the students mentioned greater investment in green transport and shifting to consumption of more local goods.

Karsten Steinfatt, WTO, applauded the realism and ambition from the students. He pointed out that the WTO takes into consideration the entire lifecycle of products, and products that come from far away do not always have a bigger carbon footprint. Steinfatt said it is necessary to inform consumers to help them choose the most environmentally friendly products. He also emphasized that the WTO does not advocate “trade for trade’s sake,” but rather prioritizes “good trade,” beneficial for the economy as well as the environment.

After some dialogue between the ambassadors and the students, Brianna Kerr, Director and Head of Impact at Kua, Sydney, Australia, delivered the last presentation. She introduced Kua – a student-created company that sources ethical coffee from smallholder farms in Uganda. Prioritizing a circular model, Kua rethinks waste by collecting customers’ coffee grounds and distributing them to local farms in the Sydney area. The company uses its profits to fund climate resilience projects in Uganda. Kerr hoped to open source Kua’s business model so that other social entrepreneurs could replicate it in their countries.

The ambassadors then offered concluding remarks. Waldmann wished to continue conversations with youth in future WTO Trade and Environment Weeks, and stated that the German Mission is ready to sponsor upcoming events.

Blackman hoped the event would become a permanent fixture of future Trade and Environment Weeks, and expressed readiness to work with young people in Geneva to take their ideas forward through a Geneva-based network of youth interested in trade and environment.

The asset manager has unveiled the Allianz Positive Change, Allianz Clean Planet and Allianz Food Security funds, which will be jointly managed by its thematic team under Citywire A-rated Andreas Fruschki (pictured).

The team currently includes portfolio managers David Finger, Kofi Tweneboa-Kodua, Robbie Miles and Shibo Wang, as well as product specialist Alexandra Russo.

The new equity funds will closely follow eight larger themes: social inclusion, health, financial inclusion, education, food security, water, clean land/circular economy and energy transition.

The team will select companies that offer solutions to issues addressed by one or more of the SDGs. This in turn will allow the team to tap into specific themes and topics, for example education technology within the education theme or sustainable agriculture within food security.

The Allianz Positive Change fund, for example, will invest a minimum of 90% of its assets in the shares of international companies providing solutions to achieve the UN SDGs.

Meanwhile, the Allianz Clean Planet fund targets companies offering products or solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges related to three dimensions of a clean environment: clean air, clean land, clean water.

The third new strategy, the Allianz Food Security fund, allocates to companies offering products or solutions that actively contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes along the entire food supply chain across production, transportation, quality and safety of food.

For all three strategies up to 50% of their assets may be invested in the emerging markets. The SDG-aligned strategies also take an active approach to ESG integration, including a detailed assessment of the most significant risk factors, and exclusion criteria.

The three new strategies will sit alongsid the group’s existing thematic funds, which include the Allianz Global Water and Allianz Smart Energy funds.

Commenting on the launches, Fruschki said: ‘While each company that we consider eligible for an SDG strategy has a clear role to play in achieving the relevant SDG, the exact extent of its contribution to the UN goal can be difficult to quantify. That makes a thorough, qualitative research process essential.’

‘Given the global focus on the UN goals, companies that directly support them are likely to benefit from increased interest and growth. This may represent a strong investment case generating sustainable returns,’ he added.

The 17 sustainable development goals of the UN have 169 underlying targets, addressing global challenges related to society and the environment. According to UN, $2.5trn of capital is needed annually to finance the achievement of the goals.","Allianz Global Investors has launched three thematic strategies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Citywire Selector has learned.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade (MIT) and their partners - the Environmental Investment Fund (EIF) and Standard Bank Namibia (SBN), launched the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF) on Monday, 2 November 2020. The SDGIF will be used to provide mentorship grants and debt financing to women and youths in business, social enterprises and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Fulfilling the promise of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires multi-sectoral approaches that bring together expertise from a range of perspectives. Harnessing comparative advantages and working within the context of respective mandates can collectively make significant progress towards realising the vision of the SDGs. UNDP Namibia, in partnership with SBN, MIT and EIF, will initiate three SDGIF calls for proposals during the respective earmarked windows to provide competitive matching grant awards, as well as mentoring, capacity building and entrepreneurship development training to MSMEs. The grants are aimed at MSMEs operating in any of the targeted sectors of agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, renewable energy, information technology, and with a product or service on the market. By creating a two-tier structure, stakeholders are attempting to ensure that promising MSMEs can access capital through private financing and are supported, while those that show promise are also given an opportunity.

In Tier One, successful MSMEs will receive a one-off limited duration grant, usually covering up to 50% of project costs (or up to N$650 000 as appropriate) with the remainder to be matched by own contribution or loan from a financial institution.

In Tier Two for Vulnerable MSMEs, successful applicants will receive a one-off, limited duration grant, usually covering up to 90% of project costs (or up to N$50 000 as appropriate) with the remaining 10% to be matched by own-in kind contribution.

At the launch, Minister of Industrialisation and Trade Lucia Iipumbu reiterated that “The MIT’s Growth at Home strategy implores us that we look locally at how we can support our economy. To attain the noble objectives of our Growth at Home implies the need to ensure that all strategic levers to support and sustain enterprise development are fully embraced. The establishment of the SDG Impact Facility platform with our technical partner UNDP Namibia is, therefore, based on this premise.”

The minister further stated the business case for supporting initiatives with a direct link to the SDGs is strong and offers a compelling growth strategy for the private sector, as it opens new opportunities, enormous efficiency gains; drives innovation, and enhances reputations.

Also, at the launch, Alka Bhatia, UNDP Resident Representative for Namibia said: “The concept to building back better and growing our own sustainable future will require a collective effort to not only address immediate challenges but ensuring that the pre-existing inequalities are also tackled with as much vigour as we did with the pandemic. This period has reminded us of the importance of having robust and strong systems that are able to withstand shocks across our different sectors.”

Delivering the closing remarks, CEO of Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia Benedict Libanda stated that: “This partnership provides an excellent opportunity to scale up financing for sustainable development in Namibia. The Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia is honoured to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility as one of the four major institutional stakeholders. Getting financing right is critical to meet the SDGs and our Vision 2030. Domestic finance and international development cooperation nevertheless remain central for the achievement of the SDGs. In every country, domestic public finance, in particular, has been the largest and most important source of finance for sustainable development. Private sector presents a huge opportunity to accelerate the attainment of the SDGs. However, unlocking private investment has been a major challenge despite the fact that there is enough capital on the domestic market.”","Staff ReporterThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade (MIT) and their partners - the Environmental Investment Fund (EIF) and Standard Bank Namibia (SBN), launched the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF) on Monday, 2 November 2020.

According to Invest India CEO & MD Deepak Bagla, India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs globally and the 'SDG Investor Map for India' will be an instrumental stride in India's development trajectory.

Shoko Noda, UNDP India Resident Representative said that the SDG Investor Map comes at a critical time for India, as the financing gap for the SDGs in India has only widened further with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

SDG Investor Map: Key highlights

•Among the identified 18 investment opportunities areas (IOAs), 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen strong private equity and venture capital activity.

•The areas have companies that have been successful in unlocking scale and demonstrate profitability.

•The remaining 8 IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have received attention from early-stage investors.

•Besides the IOAs, the map also identified 8 white space that have the potential to grow into IOAs within 5-6 years. The areas have seen considerable investor interest.

•The white spaces would, however, require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

•Almost 50 percent of the shortlisted investment opportunities areas have historical investments that have yielded IRRs over 20 percent.

•Besides this, 84 percent of the areas have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).

Significance The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in the investment opportunities areas and SDG enabling sectors, closing the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Investing in the Sustainable Development Goals will also be crucial for ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhance India’s resilience to future threats.

Benefits

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability would boost the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology that will be of the essence to India, as it combats the challenges of a post-COVID economy.

Around 83 percent of the identified investment opportunities areas address job creation and industrialization needs, while 70 percent focus on inclusive business models and 50 percent on leveraging digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

Other Details

•The SDG Investor Map lays out ways to bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for 6 SDG-enabling sectors including Healthcare, Education, Financial Services, Sustainable Environment, Agriculture & Allied Activities and Renewable Energy & Alternatives.

•The ways are found by mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest.

•These sectors and the IOAs were selected after a detailed analytical process that included extensive consultations with major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

The 2020 Leaders’ Summit focused on the theme, ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All by Empowering People, Safeguarding the Planet, and Shaping New Frontiers.’

The ‘G20 Riyadh Summit’ convened virtually from 21-22 November. The Saudi G20 Presidency focused on issues including structural inequalities and debt repayments at a time when resources are needed to address the pandemic and ensure sustainable development.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G20 Leaders commit to leading the world in shaping a “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-COVID-19 era,” and emphasize the importance of “coordinated global action, solidarity and multilateral cooperation” to overcome current challenges and realize opportunities for all by “empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.” The Declaration focuses on four areas:

rising to the challenge together to address the pandemic, including through implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI;

building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, including points on health, trade and investment, and other financial topics;

ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities, including points related to sustainable development, access to opportunities, employment, women’s empowerment, education, tourism, and migration and forced displacement; and

ensuring a sustainable future, through work on environment, energy and climate, agriculture, and water.

A G20 press release notes that the G20 DSSI will provide the poorest and most vulnerable countries with “urgent and immediate liquidity relief from official bilateral creditors.” The Initiative provides USD 14 billion in 2020 to tackle the pandemic and its economic and social impacts. In addition, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working to provide US 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries between April and December 2020, as part of a broader USD 230 billion package for low-income and emerging countries. According to the release, G20 countries have also provided USD 21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, and over USD 1 trillion to support the global economy.

On building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, leaders addressed, inter alia:

the importance of tackling health and global pandemic preparedness, prevention, detection and response and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases based on a One Health approach;

trade and investment, including endorsing the G20 Actions to Support World Trade and Investment on the Future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recognizing the contribution of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO in allowing an additional opportunity to discuss and reaffirm the objectives and principles of the multilateral trading system (MTS) and to demonstrate ongoing political support for WTO reform. Leaders further recognize the need to increase the sustainability and resilience of supply chains to foster the integration of developing and least developed countries (LDCs) into the trading system and to promote inclusive economic growth, including through increased participation of micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in international trade and investment;

transportation and travel, including ensuring that global transportation routes and supply chains remain open, safe and secure;

international finance architecture, including a commitment to continue the process of International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform and an invitation to the IMF to prepare an analysis of external financing needs in low-income developing countries in future years, outlining sustainable options;

financial sector issues, such as a commitment to the Financial Stability Board’s principles underpinning national and international responses to COVID-19 and a work plan to improve the resilience of the non-bank financial sector;

digital economy, recognizing that universal, affordable, and secure connectivity is a key enabler for the digital economy and a catalyst for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and innovation;

international taxation; and

anti-corruption, including welcoming the first G20 Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting and endorsing the G20 Call to Action on Corruption and COVID-19.

On ensuring a sustainable future, leaders committed to safeguarding the planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all, including through conserving the marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Leaders launched the Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to conserve coral reefs and the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. They reaffirmed commitment to reduce marine plastic litter and to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Leaders further recognized the importance of expediting universal access to affordable and reliable energy for all, and endorsed the Circular Carib Economy Platform.

Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities.

Addressing the Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres outlined three key areas where G20 leadership is key to building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future:

halting the further spread of the pandemic;

mobilizing the resources to build forward better; and

aligning recovery efforts with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.

He said we have a “moral obligation” to ensure that the trillions of dollars “we are borrowing from future generations” for COVID‑19 recovery “does not leave them burdened by a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

In an address, WTO Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff identified three challenges facing WTO members: using trade to boost the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; facilitating trade in essential medical products needed to treat the pandemic; and reforming institutions that govern global trade, including restoring the WTO’s deliberative and negotiating functions and providing binding dispute settlement. He said a trade finance initiative should be seen as an essential part of economic recovery, and urged the G20 to support WTO action on economic recovery, pandemic response, and WTO reform.

The G20 brings together some of the largest economies, amounting to around 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic global issues. The G20 consists of 19 countries and the EU. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Turkey, the UK, and the US. In 2020, Spain, Jordan, Singapore, and Switzerland were invited as guest countries.

“Let’s get on with it.” That’s the message Dominic O’Neill, executive director of the newly launched Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, has for the sector on World Toilet Day.

“We know what needs to happen and we have a lot of good examples, but we now need to take it to scale and to bring about this much-needed change,” he said, adding that with progress on access to safely managed sanitation “well off-track” and “significantly overdue,” a change in collective behavior and commitment from all is vital.

Around the world, more than 4 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines, and 3 billion don’t have a basic hand-washing facility with water and soap at home.

“SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene Fund

To help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week. Working with donors and other partners, it aims to enhance the international response to the sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health crisis by providing grants to low-income countries for community-based solutions.

O’Neill said now is the time for a different type of approach.

“Not just because of COVID-19, but this is a very significant moment where the whole world is talking about the need for good basic hygiene in a way that we couldn’t have dreamed of before and they have a different level of understanding.”

How to campaign for WASH during an election With multiple elections on the calendar for 2020, WASH professionals discuss how to make clean water access and improved sanitation a priority for politicians.

Speaking to Devex, O’Neill explained why progress has been waning on Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 on sanitation and hygiene and the gaps this new fund can help to plug.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

What is the status of progress around SDG 6, and how does its progress impact other SDGs?

We know that in particular, SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it. Presently, we see nothing that is changing business as usual in a way that will make the difference. Goodwill and effort alone will not get us to our collective goal. Our feeling is that something isn’t working in the current approach and we want to change that.

This isn’t just about hitting that SDG on safely managed sanitation. We know the outcomes of having better sanitation and hygiene are much broader including the impact on girls’ education, gender equality, reducing sexual and gender-based violence, and on critical health indicators.

One of the other outcomes that we want to really focus on is the economic impact, not only the negative impact of people getting ill from preventable diseases and not being able to go to work but the economic potential and opportunity within the sanitation economy.

Speaking at the launch of the new Sanitation and Hygiene Fund on Nov. 17, Executive Director Dominic O’Neill said, “We know that money, well utilized, has the ability to drive positive and lasting change.” Photo by: SHF

If sanitation plays such an obviously central role in development, why are we not making adequate progress?

The sector is often poorly understood and lacks a champion. We’re hoping to turn over some typical thinking about sanitation because this isn’t just about the health indicators. This is a matter of basic human rights. This is about the dignity and ability to carry out normal bodily functions in a safe, hygienic, and dignified way so we need to raise awareness. We’ve done a lot of work over the last few years looking at the human rights element, and that’s a very important part of the approach for us.

This is an SDG target, but it’s also a very basic human right. Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better, in terms of the national and local benefit from a health perspective, from an education perspective, a gender perspective, and also from an economic perspective.

The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund launched two days ago. What is it, and what are its aims?

We’re evolving out of an organization that’s existed for 30 years: the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, which has been very successful and for the last 10 years has run a global sanitation fund, piloting a lot of equality-based approaches. About a year ago, there was a strategic review, and it was decided that there were two issues around why we weren’t seeing the change in the indicators and why we weren’t having the desired impact. The sector needs to be able to go to scale, and the current approach risks us going through pilot after pilot and project after project.

So this is the basis of our business model: we will raise funds, then provide grants to country governments, who will also co-finance. They’re using domestic resources, but we also hope to crowd in other potential investors, non-traditional donors, and countries that may not normally participate in this type of fund. We’re looking, for example, at Gulf donors, philanthropic funding, impact investment, social investors, and the like.

Through our financing, we will encourage and incentivize governments to present a nationally costed plan for sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health. [This is] a result of multistakeholder dialogue, and therefore country-owned, implemented, and monitored, which means it’s their plan, it’s based on their priorities, it aligns with their funding priorities, and with their own systems. We’re not doing projects, we’re basically inserting sanitation and hygiene into their routine development and investment planning and catalyzing it with external and funds from different sources.

There have been so many good examples of solutions, however, we’re just not seeing that long-term sustainability and the sustained impact over time. That’s because too many approaches have either been projectized as short-term interventions or there isn’t a local buy-in so once that activity stops, it doesn’t continue and behaviors aren’t changed, and facilities fall into disrepair.

“Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better.” —

How is COVID-19 affecting the work of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund?

Definitely, it’s given this issue a major push. As you can imagine, the world is focused on finding a vaccine. However, people [are realizing] a vaccine is not a straightforward issue and that not everybody can afford, or has access to, a mask or can do social distancing. So, you’re left with a very basic and important behavior, which is your ability to frequently wash your hands.

Kevin Rudd's guide to making the case for WASH financing The former Australian prime minister and high-level chair of Sanitation and Water for All sends a message to finance ministers ahead of SWA's upcoming meetings for WASH.

We’re yet to see the definitive entry points. We think we have a good proposition which can improve the facilities in both health centers and in education, and at the household level. We are exploring funding options to secure further support to be able to turn our plans into reality.

As the executive director of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, why did you take on this job?

My career started in environmental health. In 1996, I took a voluntary service overseas placement in Namibia working on sanitation and health education in a district health team, and afterwards, I joined the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development as their environmental health adviser in 2002. I then went off in different aspects of my career including heading up DFID country offices in Yemen, Sierra Leone, and Nepal and I was on the board of the African Development Bank for three years representing the U.K. government. This role brings me to where my early passion and career started.","On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene FundTo help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week.

The partnership with UNDP India to develop the first-ever ‘SDG Investor Map for India’ will be an instrumental stride in India’s development trajectory and data-backed research and insights will serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India, said Mr. Deepak Bagla, CEO & MD, Invest India on the launch occasion.

Ms Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India acknowledged the launch of the Map at a time of pandemic to make economy and society more resilient and sustainable. This map uses critical factors such as enhanced productivity, technology adoption and increased inclusion to identify attractive sectors for investors.

Highlights

Out of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust Private Equity and Venture Capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability. The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors.

The map has also identified eight White Spaces, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs within a 5-6-year horizon. However, these require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

Nearly 50% of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded internal rate of return (IRRs) in excess of 20%.

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability, push forward the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology will be of essence to India as it grapples with the challenges of a post-COVID economy. The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in SDG enabling sectors and IOAs, bridging the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Moreover, investing in the SDGs is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhancing India’s resilience to future threats. 84% of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years) and 83% of the identified IOAs address job creation and industrialization needs, 70% focus on inclusive business models and 50% leverage digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

By mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest, the SDG Investor Map lays out pathways that can bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for SDG-enabling sectors such as Education, Healthcare, Agriculture & Allied Activities, Financial Services, Renewable Energy & Alternatives and Sustainable Environment. These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of investors.","UNDP and Invest India have launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical SDG enabling sectors, that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development.

MANILA – A Filipino startup has been recognized globally for developing a dengue hotspot prediction system using satellite and climate data in the 2020 Group on Earth Observations Sustainable Development Goals (GEO SDG) Awards for the sectoral category, for-profit.

The Advanced Early Dengue Prediction and Exploration Service (Project AEDES) is one of startup CirroLytix’s flagship projects developed during the 2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) International Space Apps Challenge.

It combines digital, climate, and remote sensing to nowcast dengue trends and detect mosquito habitats to help pre-empt cases of dengue.

Project AEDES process leverages normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) readings from Landsat and Sentinel-2 to estimate still water areas on the ground, which is correlated with dengue case counts from national health centers.

Dominic Vincent ""Doc"" Ligot, co-founder and chief technology officer of CirroLytix, describes Project AEDES as an ""early detection of panics from online searches, anticipating case counts from environment readings, but most importantly pinpointing hotspots from mosquito habitat detection.""

Sustainable dev’t efforts

The GEO SDG Awards recognize the productivity, ingenuity, proficiency, novelty, and exemplary communications of results and experiences in the use of Earth observations to support sustainable development.

CirroLytix Research Services was formed to create social impact through big data. Through the application of machine learning, data engineering, remote sensing, and social listening, the Philippines-based data analytics firm hopes to help governments, researchers, non-government organizations (NGO), and social enterprises achieve positive change.

COVID-19 impact measurement

Aside from winning last year, CirroLytix also developed an integrated public policy information portal measuring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic using Earth observation, in-country economic and human mobility data, and global infection case counts, thus winning again in the Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge for the same category in the best use of data.

Named G.I.D.E.O.N. (Global Impact Detection from Emitted Light, Onset of COVID-19, and Nitrogen Dioxide), this dashboard for policy makers and economic planners shows the impact of COVID-19 on various countries and effects on the economy and environment.

With these achievements, Cirrolytix is recognized in their remarkable efforts to utilize Earth observation data to predict dengue fever cases in the Philippines in order to improve public health.

""I am glad that the GEO SDG Awards Panel has selected CirroLytix for an award, recognizing the importance of this work in developing an EO-integrated dengue case predictor mapping system,"" according to Argyro Kavvada, lead for Sustainable Development Goals of the Earth Science Division, NASA's Science Mission Directorate and executive secretary of the international Earth Observations for the Sustainable Development Goals (EO4SDG).

""These awards really could stand as an inspiration to all of us about what can be done, and what needs to be done to ensure that Earth-observations contribute to make our world a better, and more sustainable place,"" said Lawrence Friedl director of the applied sciences program of the earth science division, NASA's science mission directorate and co-chair of EO4SDG.

DTI Undersecretary Rafaelita M. Aldaba lauded CirroLytix saying it’s a “blessing amid this pandemic and economic crisis that we are currently faced with.” (PR)","The Advanced Early Dengue Prediction and Exploration Service (Project AEDES) is one of startup CirroLytix’s flagship projects developed during the 2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) International Space Apps Challenge.
It combines digital, climate, and remote sensing to nowcast dengue trends and detect mosquito habitats to help pre-empt cases of dengue.

It’s only morning.”

An OPP cruiser, lights flashing, was parked in front of the Ingleside Foodland. There, a few volunteers and two auxiliary sergeants were on hand to collect monetary donations as well as food donations — and they were quite busy.

It was a different story for the SDG Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Stuff the Cruiser event however. Held on Saturday at various locations — Alexandria, Winchester, Ingleside, Chesterville and Morrisburg from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., the fundraiser that aims at filling local food bank shelves was a hit.

In order to help the fundraiser, Foodland offered shoppers the chance to purchase bags of already assembled, non-perishable foods. These were made up of food staples — beans, pasta, pasta sauce and cans of soups.

Nearly every shopper that left the store had one in their cart, which they gently placed inside of giant barrels resembling cans of soup.

Yet it wasn’t just food donations that were handed out — so was money and lots of it.

“Usually, we have people handing us five dollars or something like that,” said Chris Quenville, another Agape Centre volunteer. “But today, we had people giving us forty dollars and even fifty dollars. It’s incredible. We even had someone give us 60 dollars. We’ve never seen this.”

Both Auxiliary Sgt. Doug Behn and Auxiliary Sgt. Lambia Kavitsiotis were also impressed with the amount of donations that were flowing out of the store during the fundraiser.

“The feedback we’ve been getting is very positive,” said Kavitsiotis. “People are really being generous today, it’s great.”

“This is their biggest food fundraiser and the barrels they brought are already nearly full,” added Behn.

The Agape Centre, like many other local food banks, has seen its customer base increase during the COVID pandemic.

“We serve 90 to 100 a day for hot lunches, three days a week,” said Quenville. “Some of them are also people we don’t recognize, people that have never had to come to us before.”

According to him, some of the Agape’s clientele is now made up of individuals having come from as far as Toronto or Ottawa.

“When the pandemic happened, they left the big hubs for smaller places,” he said. “It’s been very busy at the Agape.”

Although the exact number of donations had yet to be tallied, last year’s event resulted in a total of $3,700 in monetary donations and 4,400 pounds of food.

338,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-index-finds-no-european-country-on-track-green-deal-brings-potential/,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Index Finds No European Country on Track, Green Deal Brings Potential","The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) launched the 2020 edition of the Europe Sustainable Development Report (ESDR). The ESDR 2020 provides an updated SDG Index and Dashboards for European countries, reports on spillover effects on other countries, and makes recommendations for strengthening SDG implementation and the European Green Deal.

The ESDR 2020 is the second report on the SDG progress of the EU, its member states, and other European countries. The report is part of a broader series of Sustainable Development Reports tracking the performances of countries and municipalities around the world on the SDGs. The 2020 ESDR examines six policy levers and tools for implementing SDG transformations in the EU:

A New European Industrial and Innovation Strategy for the SDGs; An investment plan and financing strategy aligned with the SDGs; Coherent national and EU SDG policies; Coordinated Green Deal and SDG Diplomacy; Regulations on business standards and reporting; and SDG monitoring and reporting framework.

The report finds that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, “no European country was on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.” The region faces the greatest challenges on sustainable agriculture and diets (SDG 2), climate (SDG 13), biodiversity (15), and in addressing inequalities in living standards across its countries and regions (SDGs 1 and 10). The authors report that unsustainable diets, high and rising obesity rates, and unsustainable agriculture and farming practices are contributing to the EU and partner countries “performing especially poorly” on SDG 2.

The Nordic countries again performed the best on the SDG Index. Finland placed the highest, with a score of 81.10. Other countries in the top five are: Sweden (81.02), Denmark (80.05), Austria (77.35), and Norway (77.03). Even these countries face challenges on several SDGs. Finland, for instance, received red scores (classified as “major challenges remain”) on SDG 2, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13. Sweden scored red on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15.

The report features a leave no one behind score that tracks four dimensions of inequality: poverty, services, gender, and income. Countries with a higher score have fewer population groups that are being left behind. Norway (87.03), Finland (86.69), and Iceland (84.23) placed the highest. Greece (57.82), Bulgaria (47.97), and Romania (47.74) ranked the lowest.

On COVID-19, the report observes that suppressing the virus remains an urgent priority for the EU. The EU has recorded more cases and deaths from COVID-19 than the Asia-Pacific region. The authors underscore the need to strengthen the EU’s preparedness, coordination, and resilience for pandemics in order to achieve SDG target 3.d on preparedness for global health security issues, and to prepare for climate-related and other risks. The report further recommends using the SDGs as a framework to build back better and investing in green infrastructure, digitization, and responsible consumption and production, combined with efforts and investments to boost education and skills throughout Europe and coordinated efforts to reform tax systems, particularly digital taxes.

The report highlights the potential of the Next Generation EU-COVID-19 recovery package and the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2021-2027) to put Europe on a path towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery. SDSN Executive Director Guido Schmidt-Traub called on the EU to “provide global leadership on the goals.” He said the EU has the tools in place to achieve the SDGs internally, but they “must be more clearly organized around the six transformations.” In addition the EU must be prepared to “promote SDG and Green Deal diplomacy ahead of the climate and biodiversity COPs in 2021.”

The report includes the 2020 International Spillover report, which shows how unsustainable supply chains and trade-related spillovers from the EU have “serious environmental, social and economic consequences for the rest of the world.” For example, unsustainable supply chains lead to deforestation and increased biodiversity threats, hindering global progress on SDGs 13 and 15. EU imports of clothing, textile, and leather products are linked with 37 fatal workplace accidents and 21,000 non-fatal accidents per year. The report recommends that the EU address negative international spillovers by reducing trade in waste, enacting coherent trade and external policies, strengthening tax cooperation and transparency, and applying EU standards to exports.

The German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, and the European Network of Political Foundations provided support for the report. SDSN and IEEP produced the report in collaboration with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), SDSN Germany, and national and regional SDSN networks in Europe.

341,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/investing-in-disability-inclusion-is-our-shared-responsibility/,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Investing in Disability Inclusion Is Our Shared Responsibility,"By Olga Algayerova

Globally, people living with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and face higher rates of violence and abuse, particularly women and girls. This is unacceptable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for action to address barriers to full socio-economic participation even clearer. We must join forces for a disability-inclusive future, harnessing multilateral engagement at UNECE and beyond.

An estimated one billion people worldwide live with disabilities. In the European Union, one person in seven among the working age population reports a difficulty with a basic activity – such as walking, seeing or hearing, lifting or carrying, sitting or standing, and remembering and concentrating. Less than one out of two people with a basic activity difficulty are employed, compared to 67% for those with no such difficulty. Many people with disabilities also face challenges to fully access education and participate in community life.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, health and socioeconomic impacts are disproportionately felt by people with disabilities, and overrepresented among the most at-risk groups, especially older populations. Up to September 2020, nearly nine of ten COVID-19 related deaths reported in the UNECE region were among adults aged 65 years and older. This was a key focus of our recent multi-stakeholder discussions and new policy guidance, mobilizing the best expertise from across the region to support more age-inclusive emergency planning and response. We must all scale up efforts as part of a broader push for disability inclusion across all areas.

Civil society engagement led to electric cars being required emit an audible signal at low speeds, reducing dangers for blind and visually-impaired persons.

This is the urgent call made in the UN Secretary-General’s policy brief on a disability-inclusive COVID-19 response. It outlines practical steps countries can take to ensure that people with disabilities are fully accounted for in response and socioeconomic recovery packages, charting a course for an inclusive, human rights-based approach in consultation with persons with disabilities. I urge all governments of our region to adopt such an approach, in line with their commitments under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

On this year’s International Day of Persons with Disabilities, marked on 3 December, let us commit to action for a disability-inclusive, accessible and sustainable post-COVID-19 world. Unless we factor in disability inclusion across all policy areas and in all sectors, we lose sight of the 2030 Agenda’s fundamental vision for a future that “leaves no one behind.”

Leveraging its areas of expertise, I am proud that UNECE is making significant contributions to the development of norms and standards that can make a real difference for disability inclusion. For example, civil society engagement through the World Blind Union brought the issue of potentially dangerous “silent” electric vehicles to the attention of UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. This led to the adoption in 2016 of a binding UN regulation establishing requirements for electric cars to emit an audible signal at low speeds, reducing dangers for blind and visually-impaired persons and other vulnerable road users. A further UN regulation covering the construction of buses and coaches lays down the technical requirements to ensure accessibility for people with reduced mobility, including wheelchair users. These norms already benefit millions of people in countries all around the world, and I encourage their even wider application.

Stepping up for inclusiveness means systematically addressing the barriers faced by people with disabilities in our everyday environments. Recognizing inaccessible housing as a critical issue, the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, endorsed by UNECE, encourages the implementation of universal design principles to increase the usability of homes for all, irrespective of disability status, age, or gender. Addressing another key issue, the Protocol on Water and Health is supporting 12 countries in the pan-European to collect data and evaluate barriers faced by persons with disabilities in accessing water and sanitation services, and to put in place measures to address gaps. And to come back to the question of population ageing, which is particularly critical in the UNECE region, our Road Maps for Mainstreaming Ageing are helping Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova to improve accessibility of transport, housing, health care, and other areas. UNECE’s statistical recommendations further support countries to consider disability as a key domain in ageing-related statistics and to identify indicators on which national statistical offices should collect data.

These are just a few examples to illustrate the strong engagement of countries and stakeholders in our region for disability inclusion, and how their cooperation at UNECE is helping to turn commitment into action. These efforts are contributing to the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, launched in 2019, which sets out to transform the United Nations System into an accessible and inclusive environment where people with disabilities can engage without any obstacles. As we look to the future of multilateralism as the UN turns 75, strengthening inclusion must be a central priority in all of our work.

UNECE is also making a concerted effort to factor disability inclusion into its meeting planning and working methods. In partnership with our hosts at UN Geneva, this provides great opportunities for common approaches to strengthen both physical accessibility and digital inclusiveness. In our multilateral engagement, maximizing inclusiveness is crucial – both to harness the perspectives, skills, and creativity of all stakeholders to help us address shared challenges, and to ensure that decisions affecting our common future reflect everyone’s needs.

Ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities also informs cross-cutting cooperation through the regional UN system, including for the ICPD follow-up process to review member States’ progress across a range of population and development issues, and the Issue-Based Coalition on Social Protection. It is also a key dimension of the vibrant civil society engagement in the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UNECE Region, notably through the European Disability Forum (EDF). For our 2019 and 2020 editions of the Regional Forum (held respectively as in-person and hybrid/virtual events), we also made every effort to follow the EDF guide for accessible meetings for all.

In the midst of today’s global crisis and as we look to the great challenges ahead, we have no choice but to work together. We need common solutions that meet the needs of all members of society, and we need broad and effective engagement from different actors. I urge all governments of our region and all stakeholders to join UNECE and the wider UN system in investing in disability inclusion.

This decision provides “financial certainty for a new year that will still be marked by the uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported.

The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was postponed from October 2020 until 2021 due to the pandemic. In addition to the adoption of a much anticipated post-2020 global biodiversity framework, this meeting would have also adopted the budget that would continue to fund the Secretariat after 31 December 2020, among other decisions. In order to keep the lights on, so to speak, delegations undertook a virtual decision making process in November for:

The second extraordinary meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties (ExCOP 2);

The first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CP ExCOP/MOP 1); and

The first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) (NP ExCOP/MOP 1).

The draft budget was agreed via silence procedure on 27 November 2020. The interim budget for 2021 consists of “old” and “new” monies. The old monies involve the extension of the validity of funds allocated in the 2019-2020 budget associated with the costs of the meetings of the COP and its subsidiary bodies that were postponed due to the pandemic. The new monies include the approval, on an exceptional basis, a core 2021 programme budget.

When COP 15 convenes in 2021, parties will have an ambitious agenda: to “do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change in 2015,” in the words of UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir. As the ENB reports, “all of the 2010-2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been missed, making it even more important to ramp up collective ambition and willingness to do better in defining and implementing goals and targets for the next decade.”

The ENB notes that regardless of whether negotiations must continue taking place virtually, or in-person meetings are able to resume, a legitimate and effective post-2020 framework will require equitable representation by parties, organizations, and other stakeholders.

A new schedule for meetings in 2021 is being developed, with the aim of bringing “this negotiation to the finish line.”

The WTO’s 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) and SDG target 14.6 give negotiators the task of securing an agreement on eliminating subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and to prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing by the end of 2020. In March 2020, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the suspension of in-person meetings, and members used online meetings and written exchanges to continue negotiations. Despite their efforts and “almost daily” meetings in late November, WTO members were unable to finish negotiations at the 14 December informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee.

Throughout 2020, members have negotiated on the basis of a draft consolidated text first introduced in June 2020 and then on a revised version introduced in early November 2020. The draft text addresses all the main pillars of the negotiations, including prohibitions on subsidies, a placeholder for a capping mechanism and a list of non-harmful subsidies, provisions for special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries (LDCs), technical assistance and capacity building, notification and transparency, institutional arrangements, and dispute settlement. During the final “cluster” of discussions in the 2020 work programme, heads of delegations provided drafting suggestions on IUU fishing, overcapacity and overfishing, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.

On overfishing and overcapacity, a provision in the draft text allows members to maintain or grant certain capacity-building subsidies if a member can demonstrate that fishery management measures are being implemented to maintain a sustainable level of fish stocks. Brazil and the US urged elaborating on a capping mechanism in the text to complement overcapacity prohibitions that are currently in the draft.

On special and differential treatment, members reiterated varying positions during a 2 December meeting. India had proposed draft text to exempt from subsidy bans developing countries that meet certain fishing volume and gross national income (GNI) thresholds. Several members observed a lack of convergence around this text although members also signaled openness to explore and refine the proposed criteria-based approach.

The chair of the negotiations, Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, said “while I am disappointed that we will miss the 2020 deadline, I am not discouraged.” He stressed “real progress” was made on the negotiations during 2020, despite difficulties caused by COVID-19-related disruptions, and emphasized that WTO members are committed to build on their progress and reach a conclusion.

WTO Deputy Director-General Karl Brauner recognized WTO members’ “intensive work on fisheries subsidies” at the Trade Negotiations Committee and Heads of Delegation meeting on 14 December. He agreed with Ambassador Wills’ assessment and observed that the negotiations have made “considerable concrete progress towards finding a solution that all Members can accept.” Brauner said greater political will, pressure from civil society, and renewed engagement will help members finalize an agreement. He called for “compromise by everyone, on all issues” and accelerated activity in 2021 that continues “until we deliver” an agreement.

344,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/better-care-updates-on-sdg-goal-3-in-the-dominican-republic/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Better Care: Updates on SDG 3 in the Dominican Republic,"SEATTLE, Washington — The Dominican Republic has made moderate improvements toward U.N. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which aims for good health and wellbeing in a population. In spite of this headway, the country still has major obstacles to overcome – including high rates of traffic deaths, adolescent fertility and child mortality – before it can consider SDG 3 accomplished.

Traffic Deaths

Frequent traffic deaths pose one problem impeding the Dominican Republic’s public health agenda. In fact, the Dominican Republic has the highest rate of traffic deaths per person in the Americas. The rate of traffic deaths in the small Caribbean country was 29.3 per 100,000 people in 2013. By 2016, it increased to 34.6 per 100,000. That same year, average rates in Europe totaled only 9.3 per 100,000 people.

Part of the issue stems from the local popularity of two and three-wheeled vehicles, whose riders comprise approximately 46.6% of traffic deaths in the Latin Caribbean. Two-wheeled vehicles are the preferred transportation in the region because of their heightened maneuverability and fuel efficiency. In response to this high frequency of traffic deaths, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is directing monitoring efforts and making tailored recommendations in line with its Plan of Action on Road Safety. These include recommendations for infrastructure maintenance, tighter traffic legislation and public awareness campaigns directed at underreporting.

Adolescent Fertility

The rate of adolescent fertility in the Dominican Republic has slightly decreased in recent years, but it still remains high. From 2017 to 2018, it decreased from 94.3 to 93 births per 1,000 people in girls aged 15 to 19. As with traffic deaths per person, the Dominican Republic experiences the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the Latin Caribbean, the region with the second-highest rate in the world (after sub-Saharan Africa).

Early pregnancy falls under SDG 3 in part because it poses a health risk to both mother and child. According to the NGO Girls Not Brides, pregnancy and birth-related issues cause 70,000 annual deaths worldwide among adolescent girls. Fortunately, the prevalence of skilled health workers in the Dominican Republic keeps this figure low domestically. In 2015, 99.6% of births on the island had trained medical personnel on hand, and infants who received at least two WHO-recommended vaccines had a 94% survival rate.

Child Mortality

In 2018, the national mortality rate among children under the age of five was 28.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This marks an improvement over 2014, where the reported rate was 35 deaths per 1,000 live births. However, this improvement is undermined by increases in the maternal mortality rate, which escalated from 90 to 104.4 deaths per 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2017. This is seven times higher than that of the United States. The leading cause of maternal mortality in the Dominican Republic is internal hemorrhaging.

Pablo Wagner, hospital director at Los Mina Hospital in Santo Domingo, blames the high mortality rate on poor infrastructure. Hospitals like his deliver births for free under the Dominican Republic’s public healthcare option. Given the extent of domestic poverty, however, they are crowded by mothers who cannot afford private treatment. In numbers, Los Minos is equipped to handle 1,500 to 2,000 births per year. Instead, it handles between 12,000 and 13,000 births annually. Many of these patients have received little to no maternal education or prenatal care and are therefore unable to distinguish internal hemorrhaging from other pains, bypassing the window in which doctors can save them.

While the Dominican Republic is improving on its goal to bring good health and wellness to its citizens, the new administration – which took over in August 2020 – still has significant hurdles to overcome, particularly in infrastructure and public health awareness.

The ‘Climate Dialogues’ programme included a number of mandated events for 2020 and fostered discussion of emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

The Climate Dialogues comprised nearly 60 openly webcasted events over ten days between 23 November and 4 December 2020, and were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as the Chilean Presidency of COP 25 and the incoming UK Presidency of COP 26. Several non-broadcasted events for Parties also convened to discuss outstanding negotiation issues, such as on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (market and non-market mechanisms) and common time frames for nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

During an Opening Segment, Marianne Karlsen, SBI Chair, stressed that the Climate Dialogues would ensure that key tasks scheduled for 2020 were conducted. Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, SBSTA Chair, highlighted that the Dialogues would permit interaction with the various constitutive bodies and deepen understanding of outstanding issues.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted recent “encouraging signs,” including a growing number of commitments to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said that for these targets to be credible, they must be reflected in national plans and policies as well as NDCs. She urged more progress on finance, including on the goal for developed countries to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020.

COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt noted the importance of non-state actors as key players, and welcomed recent announcements on carbon neutrality from major economies such as China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. COP 26 President Alok Sharma said the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December will provide a platform for leaders to make announcements on mitigation, adaptation, and support. He called for long-term strategies towards net-zero emissions.

During a segment titled the ‘Presidency’s Open Dialogue between Observers and Parties,’ Sharma stressed that achieving net zero and building resilience are only possible through joint efforts between parties and non-party stakeholders. He said the latter are vital for encouraging parties to raise ambition.

In the ensuing discussion between observer constituencies and parties, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the Dialogues indicates that key insights included:

Governments must work with all stakeholders in formulating their enhanced NDCs;

COVID-19 recovery should be undertaken in a way that also advances the green transition and the necessary structural transformation of economies;

According to the Production Gap Report 2020, fossil fuel production must decline by 6% per year until 2030 for Paris Agreement goals to be met, and yet G20 governments have committed over USD 230 billion to fossil fuels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic;

It is beneficial for a COP host country to “have its own house in order” to better encourage others to raise ambition;

COVID-19 and climate change are gendered crises, and both the recovery and climate action must be ambitious, inclusive, and gender-responsive;

Multilevel action is key to raising national ambition, and efforts by subnational and regional governments should be formally recognized;

Enhanced NDCs must focus on decent and good job creation, protect human and labor rights, and include workers and organizations in their creation; and

Young people have continued to organize despite the pandemic, and parties should give space and resources for youth to self-organize.

During the concluding segment, Julio Cordano, COP 25 Presidency, stressed that the COP 25 and 26 Presidencies and the Secretariat are “extremely well-coordinated” in their planning. Archie Young, COP 26 Presidency, highlighted the UK’s new NDC, which commits to a 68% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, and announced that the UK will host a series of bilateral and multilateral conversations with negotiating groups and parties in 2021.

Guyana, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said: the virtual format is not appropriate for negotiations; there is a “deficit of ambition” on pre-2020 commitments, which developed countries should address; and adaptation is lagging behind mitigation in the negotiations. Germany, for the EU, called for an inclusive, productive, and ambitious set of discussions between now and COP 26 on transparency and Article 6.

Speakers also emphasized the importance of continuing discussions, ensuring that the recovery from COVID-19 is consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, and the need to meet finance and mitigation commitments and operationalize the long-term goal on adaptation, among other priorities.

In her closing remarks, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa urged parties to “work like [they] never have before” to complete the necessary work at COP 26.

Speakers looked forward to continuing the dialogue at two virtual events the week after the Climate Dialogues concluded. The Thimphu Ambition Summit, taking place on 9 December 2020, will showcase leadership by least developed countries (LDCs) on climate action. The Climate Ambition Summit 2020, taking place on 12 December 2020, will mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.

It aims to support policymakers, researchers, and civil society to examine variables that determine the availability, value, and health consequences of food resources globally.

The Dashboard was developed by the Johns Hopkins University and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), with collaborators at Harvard University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the Agriculture-Nutrition Community of Practice.

Data on environmental factors will be added in January 2021.

Most of the data in the Dashboard is open source. It is pooled from FAO, Euromonitor International, the World Bank, and other data sources.

A “Compare and Analyze” feature allows users to explore indicators organized according to six clusters: food supply chains; food environments; individual factors; consumer behavior; diets and nutrition; and drivers. The Dashboard provides for visualizations and comparisons globally, regionally, and by country, food systems type, or income classification. The Dashboard also includes 41 indicators for each country to provide in-depth insights into the challenges and opportunities facing countries and their food systems.

The Food Systems Dashboard aims to provide a complete view of food systems, with indicators related to natural resources, climate, agriculture, policy, commerce, and culture. It shows the types of foods that constitute the average diet, where foods are sold, and the effects of climate change, urbanization, and migration, among other factors.

The Dashboard, which was launched in June 2020, is automatically updated as governments release new information. Data on environmental factors, including water quality, land use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is expected to be added to the dashboard in January 2021.

The golden thread of climate action should weave through every international gathering in 2021. COP 26 President-designate Sharma

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report of the event, which took place on 12 December 2020, indicates that statements coalesced around four themes: new and enhanced Paris Agreement medium-term plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs); long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, as requested by the Paris Agreement, and mid-century, net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and GHG emissions targets; adaptation plans and strategies; and climate finance.

Seventy-five leaders announced new commitments, some of which had been communicated in recent months or days, or indicated ongoing work. Among the major announcements were China’s NDC-related commitment to lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% by 2030, from 2005 levels; the European Union’s NDC-related pledge to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030; and the UK’s NDC-related target of reducing GHG emissions at least 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Additional pledges included:

Net zero-related pledges by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden;

by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden; Adaptation pledges by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and

by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and Climate finance pledges including from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, and the UK.

The Cities Race to Zero – part of the global Race to Zero Campaign – was joined by 72 new cities and local authorities from Belgium, China, Denmark, and the UK. And companies from the manufacturing, industry, aviation, transport, technology, and fashion industries offered mitigation pledges.

In his closing remarks, COP 26 President-designate Alok Sharma, UK, announced that the UK will double its climate finance contribution to USD 15.5 billion over the next five years.

In all, Sharma said 45 NDCs, 24 net zero commitments, and 20 adaptation and resilience plans were announced during the event.

The authors find that the VNR process is an “important engine” for countries to accelerate SDG progress, especially if strong follow-up processes are in place.

The report titled, ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews – a snapshot of trends in SDG reporting,’ notes that countries conducting review processes were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with various impacts. Holding VNR virtually broadened participation in some ways, but limited it in others due to varying digital access for different stakeholders. The pandemic also disrupted statistical activities, which may have affected the evidence base of some countries’ VNRs.

In other findings about national reporting:

SDG institutional structures and mechanisms have matured and advanced in several countries.

Countries that report for the first time can now benefit from the body of experience that has been built up globally since 2016.

Reporting typically increases from one reporting period to the next, with more content provided in the second or third reports. While some second or third reports highlight aspects of SDG implementation that were improved or lessons learned, the authors suggest that “greater continuity between the reports can enable ‘cyclical consideration’ and a structured analysis of progress.”

More individual stakeholder groups are reporting on SDG progress, and more countries are engaging stakeholders in VNR-related processes, i.e. the whole-of-society approach. However, many governments still engage stakeholders in “silos” and would benefit from multi-stakeholder (integrated) engagement. The best way for the VNR process to incorporate stakeholder input – e.g. spotlight/shadow reports, private sector reports, voluntary local reviews – is “still open to debate,” the authors write.

Progress on SDG localization is advancing, as some countries reported making headway in mainstreaming the SDGs at local level. However, further investment is needed to establish local SDG monitoring frameworks, identify existing and new local indicators, and facilitate local data collection.

Gaps in data and the lack of data availability are still considerable barriers. The report stresses that COVID-19 makes it all the more important to overcome these barriers in order to understand, manage, and mitigate the pandemic’s multiple impacts. As an example, the availability of disaggregated data is compromising compliance with the principle of LNOB, the authors argue.

The 2020 VNRs indicate that progress has been limited in supplementing and broadening official statistics, and the report notes the need to apply alternative data and raise international support for statistical capacity building.

At a virtual event to launch the report on 30 November 2020, officials and experts shared views on positive trends and areas where national governments can improve their SDG reporting. One suggested that going forward, countries provide more analytical depth when comparing their first and second reports and identifying lessons learned. The quality of the activities reported also should be analyzed, rather than only recounting activities that took place. Finally, in the 2021 VNRs, countries should reflect on their efforts to “build back better” from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants also discussed ways for countries to translate the 17 SDGs to their national priorities, and the value of using surveys to focus on people’s priorities. Mapping and modelling tools were also highlighted, including doughnut economics, the Millennium Institute’s Integrated SDGs (iSDGs) model, and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) rapid integrated assessment (RIA) tool.

In 2020 alone, the first intersection recorded two nighttime collisions. Previous collisions were attributed to weather conditions as well as driver error, according to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Both intersections — located at County Road 1 and Gilmour Road in South Dundas, as well as County Road 19 and County Road 27 in South Glengarry — have seen several collisions over the past few years. SDG staff members presented two intersection safety reviews to council on Monday.

SDG council was presented with various ways in which two intersections deemed dangerous by administration could be made safer.

For the County Road 1 and Gilmour Road intersection, administration recommended no changes to the posted speed limit.

“We do request OPP support to increase enforcement in that area and to review other engineering speed control measures,” said Michael Jan, manager of infrastructure. “We also recommend the installation of a single light fixture, as well as the ongoing maintenance of vegetation located near the intersection.”

Another recommendation included the installation of a stop bar as well as optical speed bars on Gilmour Road, as well as relocating the stop ahead sign on that same road.

Another recommendation for council to consider was the purchase and removal a residence located at the northeast corner of the intersection. This was shot down by a few councillors, who deemed it to be too expensive of a purchase.

As for the intersection in South Glengarry, no change in the posted speed limit was also recommended there.

“Speeding is not deemed to be a major concern on County Road 19 near the intersection to County Road 27,” said Benjamin de Haan, director of transportation and planning. “We also don’t believe that an overhead flashing beacon is warranted in this case.”

That’s despite a recent request by South Glengarry council that SDG install a warning device system at the problematic intersection.

de Haan did recommend however that a streetlight be installed in order to illuminate the intersection, as well as the continued monitoring of traffic volumes on County Road 27.

“We also recommend that the intersection ahead sign in both directions be relocated, as well as the stop ahead sign on County Road 27, in accordance with the Ontario Traffic Manual,” he said. “In addition to recommendations, staff also suggests investigating the use of emotionally intelligent signage at the intersection.”

The working groups are part of the intersessional process leading to the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) planned for July 2021.

The intersessional process (IP) is proceeding virtually after in-person work was postponed due to COVID-19. The IP co-chairs and the ICCM5 bureau agreed to create the virtual working groups (VWGs) and hold a series of technical briefings in order to prepare recommendations regarding the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020, including consideration for the need to develop measurable objectives in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The VWGs will focus on the following topics:

Targets, indicators and milestones: This Group will build on work to refine targets and consider possible indicators. It aims to finalize proposed targets and develop recommendations for a process to establish indicators and milestones for the targets.

Participation is open to all SAICM stakeholders. A summary document for each VWG, reflecting views expressed, will be considered at the fourth meeting of the intersessional process (IP4) in March 2021.

Online Technical Briefings are convening on: options for strengthening the SPI; the new International Labour Organization (ILO) comparative study on ILO chemical instruments; the High Ambition Alliance; and implementation of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) implementation. During the first Technical Briefing on 22 October 2020, ICCM5 Chair Gertrud Sahler emphasized the need for sound chemicals and waste management to achieve SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The briefing reviewed the mandates and modalities of the VWGs.

The work of the VWGs, the Technical Briefings, and a drafting group on a high-level declaration are expected to continue until late January/mid-February 2021.

351,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-soul,"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Soul’: Going Beyond (and Before) ‘Inside Out’,"Pixar head Pete Docter is back with another increasingly rare throwback to Pixar’s glory days, this time a fanciful exploration of the foundations of personhood and what makes life worth living.

Pete Docter’s Soul is Pixar’s third straight original feature, following Coco and Onward, that is explicitly about death, finality and, in some way, what lies beyond.

The convergence of these three films brings to a head a striking preoccupation with death that began, perhaps, in Toy Story 2, with Woody’s parental anxieties about wearing out (“Toys don’t last forever”) and being literally left on a shelf — a phrase that idiomatically evokes the anxieties of elderly parents of being cast aside and neglected by their grown children. (Underscoring the point is the nightmare image of an apathetic Andy discarding broken Woody, dropping him onto a heap of playing cards that are all the ace of spades, beneath which is a waiting trash can full of broken toy parts sucking him down into oblivion.)

Even more overtly, the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3, with the toys taking one another’s hands, was a wordlessly eloquent expression of solidarity in the face of the inevitable.

Death as a plot point or a part of life is simply a part of storytelling, and it has been part of U.S. feature animation since the days of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi.

Death as a thematic concern — recurring or sustained existential angst in the face of mortality or the permanence of separation from loved ones — is something different, and it has become particularly characteristic of Pixar.

The death of Nemo’s mother, Coral, in the prologue of Finding Nemo is basically a plot point, an inciting incident behind Marlin’s helicopter-parent anxieties. The death of Carl Fredrickson’s wife, Ellie, in the prologue of Up is different. Up is essentially about grief in various forms, both healthy and morbid; about preparing for death.

In a more low-key way, Cars 3 was about growing older and passing the torch to a younger generation — pointedly, a more diverse generation. Then came Coco, Pixar’s first film with a nonwhite cultural setting; and, now, comes Soul, Pixar’s 23rd feature, the studio’s first feature with a Black protagonist and a predominantly Black cast.

It’s the best and worst day in the life of Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), a middle-aged musician teaching middle school to pay the bills while trying to make it as a jazz pianist. In his excitement over getting the gig of his dreams — playing onstage with acclaimed jazz saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett) — he takes a careless step and winds up on the path to the Great Beyond.

(Although Joe’s accident occurs less than 10 minutes into the film, it’s the kind of thing I prefer to avoid mentioning if I can — heck, I reviewed Up without mentioning the word “balloons” — but for this review I can’t indulge my most spoiler-averse sensibilities, so caveat lector.)

Joe’s soul — a luminescent, blobbish figure with Joe’s distinguishing fedora and glasses — finds itself on a conveyor belt in an inky blackness, moving toward a vast white glow. (It’s an image overtly reminiscent of the escalator to heaven in the 1946 British classic A Matter of Life and Death.)

As souls approach the shining frontier, they float up off the conveyor belt, losing their visual distinctives and vanishing with a brief buzzing sound that (I hate to say it, but I must) made me think of a bug zapper.

Visually, the image of shining souls drawn to an immense light is far more suggestive of some transcendent higher reality than the eschatology of Coco, in which the skeletal dead, once they are finally forgotten on earth, are wracked with tremors and fade into dust. And it’s significant that where Coco speaks alarmingly of “the final death,” Soul speaks of “the Great Beyond.” Still, that zapping sound nearly ruins it.

Other souls seem content or even excited to go into the light. Joe, though, is obviously anxious not to move on just when he feels the life he wants is finally beginning. In his efforts to go against the flow, he somehow winds up in a third realm, neither Earth nor the Great Beyond, but the Great Before — also known as the “You Seminar” — where preexistent souls are prepared for life on Earth.

Here, Joe finds himself saddled with mentoring a jaded preincarnate soul (voiced by Tina Fey) known simply as “22,” who, despite being mentored by the best — and I mean the best — has never found her “spark” or special passion forming the final component of one’s personality and has no desire to live on Earth.

And here, rather than in some final judgment on the threshold of the Great Beyond, a stunned Joe is confronted with the sum total of a life that he himself can only judge as meaningless.

The director of Inside Out, Up and Monsters, Inc., as well as chief creative officer at Pixar, Docter is the only surviving member of Pixar’s original brain trust who has yet to disappoint creatively. (Lasseter’s biggest creative fail is Cars 2. Andrew Stanton and Brad Bird both stumbled with mediocre live-action sci-fi efforts — respectively, John Carter of Mars and Tomorrowland — before running back to Pixar for lesser sequels to their biggest hits, i.e., Finding Dory and Incredibles 2.)

While it doesn’t quite pack the emotional wallop of Inside Out, Soul is cut from the same creative cloth. Visionary, stylistically inventive, grand in scope and ambition, it’s a true event film in everything except, alas, its small-screen debut on Disney+.

A decade ago, “a Pixar event film” would have been a redundancy, like “an action-packed Jackie Chan movie.” Today, alas, it’s is very nearly synonymous with “a Pixar movie directed by Pete Docter.”

Perhaps that’s giving short shrift to Coco (from Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich), a film with a visual grandeur and world-building panache not unlike Soul.

But Coco — in addition to gutting its ostensible Mexican Catholic milieu with its “final death” business and scrupulously omitting any reference to prayer in connection with Day of the Dead commemoration of loved ones — relied too heavily on two of the most exhausted tropes in family films of the last decade: Junior Knows Best and The Secret Villain.

You could almost say there’s an echo of Junior Knows Best in Soul, if that term can apply to a middle-aged man still facing the disapproval of his mother (Phylicia Rashad), who runs a tailor shop, over his dreams of succeeding in the music world rather than pursuing a safe career with a pension as a music teacher.

But Soul subverts the tropes as much as it relies on them.

Like many Pixar films, it’s an odd-couple road movie and a race against time as Joe has mere hours to resolve his increasingly complicated situation vis-à-vis his corporeal status and his relationship to 22 in order to make his all-important gig with Dorothea Williams. It’s also a Ratatouille-esque tale of pursuing one’s true artistic passion against all odds — except that, ultimately, it’s not, and this is what derails the tropishness of the film’s other tropes.

An important scene takes place, fittingly, at the local barbershop, where Joe has an illuminating exchange of sorts with a bushy-bearded, massively built barber named Dez, whom Joe describes as “born to cut hair.”

The conversation reveals unexpected sides of all participants, in the process hinting that Joe may have almost as much to learn about life as 22. Soul is the most persuasive statement of an idea that Pixar has been noodling since Monsters University: the idea that a life that doesn’t go the way you dreamed can still be worth living.

Even more boldly than Inside Out — which brought us into a metaphorical visualization of a child’s inner world, including a formally inventive excursion into abstract thinking — Soul presses Pixar animation to the limit in imagining a world of metaphor beyond corporeality.

Drawing inspiration from the overtly flat, linear animation style of 1960s Disney shorts — not unlike Fantasia 2000’s Rhapsody in Blue sequence and Pixar’s own “Day & Night” short — Soul whips up a friendly world overseen by cheery, ontologically ambiguous counselors who are all called “Jerry” (voices include Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade and Wes Studi) whose look is part Picasso and part UPA short.

There’s also a bureaucratic, bean-counting (or soul-counting) antagonist — not quite a Jerry but a Terry, voiced by Maori actress Rachel House in a variation on her role in Taika Waititi’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople — who might also remind viewers a bit of Roz in Docter’s Monsters Inc., but without the surprise reveal.

The use of line, geometry, color and black and white in these sequences is formally groundbreaking in a way Pixar hasn’t been in years.

Oddly, like Coco, Soul kept reminding me of a Pixar classic that is not about life and death: Ratatouille. Among points of contact here are colorful visual abstractions of nonvisual sense experiences (much better here than in Ratatouille) and the slapstick of one mind attempting to remote-control another person’s body (very funny in both).

I was also reminded of Up as Soul takes us to a fourth realm: the “zone,” the realm “between the physical and the spiritual,” where creativity takes you when you’re “in the zone.” Those “in the zone” float above a perilous sea of dark sand in which they may become ensnared, becoming “lost souls” mired in obsession. Somewhere among those “lost souls,” surely, Up’s Charles Muntz wandered for decades. (And, perhaps, Syndrome as well, since we see the devastating potential of thoughtless or callous words from one we look up to as a mentor.)

Soul has the sharpest Pixar screenplay in years, with a screwball vibe and consistently witty use of cutaway gags. So much of it works at such a high level.

What keeps it from achieving greatness?

Partly, I think, it’s the same tendency for schematization and rationalization that Docter brought to the inner world of Inside Out, where a child has exactly five emotions, five core memories and five islands of personality; where Riley’s subconscious fears are rational things like Grandma’s vacuum and Jangles the Clown, etc.

Souls in the You Seminar each get a little badge with so many slots, and personality traits are assigned like stickers. Then there’s one special slot for your “spark,” your special passion. No one gets to Earth without a spark, and, apparently, no one gets more than one. This is too neat, especially given the movie’s big idea.

We see how personalities are formed, but where do souls come from in the first place? Soul takes us to the very frontier of the Great Beyond, but can’t manage even a whisper of real spirituality or religious curiosity.

In a heartfelt conversation with his mother, Joe mentions church as the one context in which she appreciated his music. I appreciate that the Black church, which, like the barbershop, is an important landmark in Black culture and community, is at least referenced. And I appreciate that Joe, finding himself in a world beyond corporality, wonders aloud whether he is in heaven or “h-e-double-hockey-sticks.”

Yet is there no moment in Joe’s story where it would make sense for him to offer a prayer, a whispered plea, to God or the universe or whatever power is behind the Jerries?

Then there’s Joe’s early judgment that his life was meaningless, and the lack of closure at the end, which on one level I get is the point, but on another level … well, look.

Joe’s onetime student Curly (Questlove), who gets him his dream gig, tells him that Joe’s class was the only reason he went to school. Later, Joe plays a role, sort of, helping another gifted student on the brink of quitting decide that she really does care about music.

I’m not saying I wanted Joe to have an epiphany that he’s a middle-school teacher after all. But I wanted him to come full circle at least in realizing that, like Dez the barber, he hasn’t been wasting his life teaching middle school.

352,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-wonder-woman-1984,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Wonder Woman 1984’,"Gal Gadot is back starring in the sequel to the 2017 movie currently in theatres just in time for Christmas.

Wonder Woman 1984 is bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don’t have the nerve to be.

In its fairytale tone, 1980s setting, and moral earnestness, it reminded me of Superman II, and in other ways it reminded me of Batman Returns. Nobody involved got the memo that comic-book movies in the shared-universe era of Marvel and DC films must be grounded in irony or cynicism or both.

Indeed, WW84—the only title seen onscreen—barely acknowledges that it’s meant to be part of a shared universe.

Remember that WWI-era photograph of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor that Bruce Wayne dug up in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and sent to Diana Prince by way of connecting with a mystery super-woman who might be needed again? (If you don’t remember? “WW84 is agreeably diverting” might be all you need to know.)

That bit of detective work kind of suggests that Diana (Gal Gadot) has been keeping a low profile for the past century, right? I’m not going to say that WW84 entirely forgets that, but I’m not saying it’s real concerned about it either.

After a prologue flashback to Diana’s native Themyscira — in which eager young Diana (played again by Lilly Aspell, now 13) learns a hard lesson from her aunt, Robin Wright’s stern General Antiope, about taking shortcuts and cheating truth — we catch up with Diana, nearly 70 years after her WWI exploits, working at the Smithsonian in antiquities and doing occasional superheroics. (Without quite staying out of the news, she presumably doesn’t leave a lot of photo or video evidence for Bruce Wayne to overlook.)

It’s a good thing, I guess, that Wonder Woman isn’t much more than a rumor or an urban legend, because Diana Prince isn’t much of a secret identity. Glamorous, confident, physically capable, Diana makes no effort to hide behind a façade of Clark Kent timorousness or Don Diego foppish decadence. She doesn’t even wear Lynda Carter glasses like she did in 1918.

It’s not hard to see why vulnerable, accident-prone Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), a new hire whose areas of expertise include gems, is so taken with Diana that, when the notion of having a wish granted is brought up, her first thought is to be — what else? — like Diana.

What do you wish for when you are Diana? Obviously, someone to share it all with. And not just someone, but Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who died heroically at the end of Wonder Woman.

The granting of wishes is also very much on the mind of a self-promoting would-be oil magnate and wealth guru named Maxwell Lord (The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal), whose TV ads blend Norman Vincent Peale-esque positive thinking and Kevin Trudeau-ish pyramid-scheme hucksterism. He’s part Gordon Gekko, part Gene Hackman Lex Luthor.

WW84 gracefully dovetails these characters’ comic-book destinies and desires, along with a DC Comics MacGuffin called the Dreamstone (which may put viewers in mind of Marvel’s Infinity Stones, though as with most DC/Marvel convergences DC got there first), into an elegantly simple plot that gives us two classic Wonder Woman villains — along with a global crisis of nearly Infinity War proportions.

Like the big comic-book movies of the 20th century — particularly the Tim Burton Batman films — the villains are more interesting than the hero.

Wiig brings pathos and sweetness to the improbably named Barbara Minerva, who is both awed by Diana and also can’t help resenting her perfection a bit. Then Barbara’s life turns a corner, and her pleasure at being noticed by men and flirted with by the likes of Max Lord is palpable.

As she and Diana find themselves on equal footing, the awe falls away and the resentment comes to the fore. At the same time, Barbara finds her empathy (for example, her solicitude for a homeless man for whom she regularly buys food) slipping away.

As Max, Pascal is simultaneously larger than life and smaller than he seems; you can feel him willing himself to be the titan of wealth and power he presents himself as, but hasn’t quite managed to become.

If some viewers are reminded at times of another self-promoting, womanizing figure of that era whose success has allegedly been less than represented, it’s worth noting that WW84 humanizes Max, whose deepest motivation is to make his young son Alistair (Lucian Perez) proud of him.

Ultimately, WW84 is as goodhearted toward all as its heroine, which is both its strength and its weakness.

Gadot’s Wonder Woman remains, like Christopher Reeve’s Superman, an attractively aspirational hero, a vanishing rarity in contemporary comic-book cinema. Yet there was a tension and pathos to the character of Superman, who as Clark Kent was as invisible to Lois Lane as Barbara was to men before turning that corner.

The pathos of Superman was also connected to the loss of the alien homeworld he never knew and the instigating death of his foster father, Jonathan Kent, whose salt-of-the-earth Kansas values inform Superman’s Boy-Scout character.

Wonder Woman, as appealing as she is, has none of that. It’s true that she lost Antiope to a German bullet in 1918, but Themyscira is still very much there and her mother Hippolyta is still queen.

There’s no real secret-identity duality to struggle with, and Diana’s one emotional attachment in a man’s world, to Steve Trevor, is complicated only by the fact that he’s dead. Until, you know, he isn’t? And then emotional complications do arise, and Diana finds herself facing a moral dilemma like the one Barbara faces.

Steve aside, Diana’s emotional isolation and uncomplicated perfection threatens to make her boring, a bit like Marvel’s Thor circa The Dark World — a much less perfect character, to be sure, but also a bit like Superman without the tragedy and pathos.

In the last half-hour of its 2½-hour run time, WW84 bogs down with overextended, overwrought conflict and a rushed attempt to do justice to Barbara’s ultimate transformation into Wonder Woman’s most iconic villain — a move that should have been deferred to another movie.

Add Cheetah to a long list of perennial comic-book antagonists, from Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy (Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom) to the Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan versions of the Joker, who became “one and done” villains of the week on the big screen.

I still enjoyed WW84, partly for the appealing leads and partly for the morally earnest fairytale storytelling. I wish comic-book movies tried more to be like this, and less like Avengers: Infinity War or Thor: Ragnarok or Justice League.

353,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/wto-members-review-challenges-options-for-graduating-ldcs/,"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: WTO Members Review Challenges, Options for Graduating LDCs","The last meeting of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) General Council for 2020 saw members review several agenda items related to least developed countries (LDCs). Among these was a proposed ministerial decision for extending some of the support measures LDCs receive for several years after they graduate from LDC status – especially given that some of these countries are expected to undergo that transition in the coming years.

The 16-18 December meeting of the General Council also saw a proposal aimed at supporting the establishment and growth of “cotton by-product industries” in LDCs. Examples of cotton by-products include cotton seed and hulls, with uses ranging from cooking oils to paper production. The proposal was submitted by Burkina Faso, on behalf of the Cotton-4 (C-4) countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali) and Côte d’Ivoire.

Also on the General Council’s agenda were reports on the implementation of decisions from the past three ministerial conferences, including some that involve LDC issues. These were part of a much larger agenda, which tackled issues ranging from trade and public health to the future of a long-standing moratorium on duties on electronic transmissions.

Twelve-year Extension?

The WTO agreements feature a series of provisions that set out “special and differential treatment” (S&DT) for developing and least developed country members. The approach to S&DT can vary depending on the agreement, ranging from different limits for certain types of trade-distorting subsidies to transition periods for implementing some of the WTO’s rules.

Some of the S&DT measures apply only to LDCs, which is a status based on the UN classification. Others are available to any WTO member that designates itself as a developing country. This is itself a controversial issue given that some large advanced economies, especially the US, have argued that it is vital for WTO rules and negotiations to differentiate among developing countries of varying economic heft and circumstance, while many developing countries of varying sizes have warned that development challenges manifest themselves in myriad ways and complexities and must be acknowledged.

What happens after an LDC “graduates” from that status, however, is less clear. Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, presented a communication and a related draft Ministerial Conference decision that, if adopted, would extend “support measures” available to LDCs under the WTO agreements for an additional 12-year period after graduation.

Under the draft decision, support measures are defined as “all special and differential treatment measures and exemptions available to a least developed country under existing and future WTO Agreements, Understandings, Ministerial, General Council and other relevant decisions,” as well as technical assistance, capacity building, and other measures under the WTO system meant for LDCs.

The proponents say ensuring a “smooth transition” is vital, noting that under the UN system there are provisions to support this transition. They also note there is only one mechanism at the WTO – the Enhanced Integrated Framework – that is designed to help in such transitions when it comes to the trading system.

“After leaving the category, graduating countries would normally lose access to all trade-related support measures and flexibilities granted to them, unless they request a waiver which must be approved by the whole membership,” the LDC Group’s communication notes.

The communication also warns that this creates particular challenges for LDCs on the cusp of graduation, citing as examples “their economic vulnerabilities and their limited negotiating capacity,” and noting that losing these support measures amid the devastation wrought by COVID-19 has meant that “several LDCs have been reluctant to graduate.” The Group notes that 12 LDCs are in the pipeline for graduation over the coming four years, with more expected.

While no decision was taken during the General Council meeting, according to trade sources, it drew support from China and India, while others were consulting internally. The EU, for its part, referred to existing procedures that graduating LDCs could use under the WTO system, including the use of waivers, while asking for a clarification on why the 12-year period was chosen and why such support measures should be kept in place for all countries graduating from LDC status.

US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea also raised questions about the 12-year period, asking how this would relate to the existing option available under the UN Committee for Development Policy for LDCs to delay graduation for a maximum of nine years. Another option, he said, would be for LDCs to push for that nine-year period to be extended within the UN context.

Notably, Vanuatu graduated from LDC status in early December. The Pacific island nation is a relatively recent member of the global trade club, having acceded in August 2012.

LDCs at the WTO

There are long-standing concerns over the myriad challenges that LDCs face in engaging in international trade, which have been the subject of several negotiating efforts.

For example, the difficulties that LDCs face in acceding to the WTO, a years-long process that involves negotiating with the entire membership and undertaking significant domestic reforms, prompted the adoption in 2002 of dedicated LDC Accession Guidelines. These non-binding guidelines were later updated in 2012 to include benchmarks in goods and services market access, among other features.

The move to develop revised guidelines was in response to concerns that LDCs face a significant negotiating disadvantage in accession talks, though some trade analysts have warned that the benchmarks could have limited benefits and may limit vital policy space. While 30 LDCs joined the WTO at its inception in January 1995, only six (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Liberia, Nepal, and Yemen) have acceded since, in addition to Vanuatu.

At the Geneva, Bali, and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively, WTO members endorsed decisions on select “LDC issues,” extracted from a wider suite of issues being negotiated under the WTO’s Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) in Special Session.

Among the decisions that have been adopted over the years is a decision granting preferential access to services and services suppliers from LDCs, which has been the subject of multiple decisions and follow-up work in Geneva. While over 50 WTO members have notified preferences under the waiver, trade officials and experts say more work needs to be done to ensure the waiver is being used fully, especially given the impact it could have for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Another decision, adopted in 2015, with mixed results, relates to preferential rules of origin for LDCs, specifically for imports from LDCs that are not already subject to trade preference schemes. A “Monitoring Mechanism” was adopted in 2013 to review the implementation of S&DT, in response to written submissions, though it has not since been used.

Meanwhile, the decision for developed countries, as well as those developing countries “in a position to do so,” to provide LDCs with access to their markets without subjecting their products to duties and quotas, dates back to 2005. A subsequent decision to advance progress in this area was adopted in 2013, and SDG target 17.12 calls for the “timely implementation” of this decision and related prior ones, along with making reference to the decision on preferential rules of origin.

As 2020 draws to a close, it is worth noting that there is another SDG target that refers specifically to LDCs and their challenges in the trading system. Target 17.11 calls for “significantly [increasing] the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of global exports by 2020.”

Data from the SDG Trade Monitor, a joint effort by the WTO, the International Trade Centre (ITC), and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), suggest that this target will go unfulfilled for both goods and services exports. The fact that this has gone largely unremarked by the international community is profoundly worrisome, as is the fact that many of the long-standing difficulties that LDCs face across multiple dimensions of trade and trade policy remain unresolved.

355,https://dailynewsegypt.com/2020/12/23/egypt-launches-interactive-website-to-track-sdg-aligned-development/,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Daily News Egypt,Egypt launches interactive website to track SDG-aligned development - Daily News Egypt,"On the sidelines of the release of the 2020 annual report titled, ‘International Partnerships for Sustainable Development’, Ministry of International Cooperation launched an interactive website to visualise Egypt’s SDG-aligned development story.

As all countries embark on a decade of action until 2030 to achieve the SDGs, the website aims to bridge Egypt’s local success stories with global and local audiences to provide ready-made roadmaps and blueprints for all countries to follow.

It showcases Egypt’s development through a multilateral lens; illustrating how the Ministry of International Cooperation works to apply the principles of economic diplomacy and foster inclusive partnerships to push Egypt’s development forward in partnership with governments, international development partners, the private sector and civil society.

To measure Egypt’s progress in achieving sustainable development, the website uses various interactive approaches to make it easier for audiences to digest.

First, through an interactive map of Egypt, the website allows the user to track the progress and projects being implemented for each SDG goal; exploring each SDG individually to see the number of projects and partners involved to achieve the targets of the goal.

Second, for each sector, examples of concrete projects through data-driven stories are provided as well; illustrating how Egypt is moving along global trends and development priorities for the next decade in key sectors such as agriculture, transport, energy, health, SMEs and gender equality.

Food security has gained increased significance today, particularly due to the increasing global challenges of delivering sufficient food to populations. In the ‘The Future Breadbasket’ page, the website looks at how Egypt is looking beyond just feeding communities, but also empowering communities and strengthening agriculture value chains into “smart farming” to achieve a circular economy.

In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $100m in agriculture, irrigation, and national supply through the AFD, EBRD, USAID, OPEC Fund for International Development, and bilateral cooperation with Germany.

As transportation is a prerequisite for Egypt’s social and economic development, the ‘Redefining Safe and Better Transportation’ page demonstrates how Egypt is promoting sustainable transport to improve people’s productivity by connecting them to jobs, schools and healthcare, and delivering goods and service to rural and urban communities.

In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $1.794bn in development financing in support of the transportation sector, with development partners that include the EIB, AFD, EBRD, China, and Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED).

Inclusive green growth has also become increasingly pertinent. In the ‘Think Green, Act Green’ page, Egypt’s strategy to reinvigorate green growth is reflected in several national strategies and success projects, particularly the Benban solar park. In Egypt, there are 34 projects within the Ministry of International Cooperation’s portfolio answering to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy with a total of $5.95bn, thus making up for 23.2% of the ODA; the highest ODA financing.

According to the annual report by the Ministry of International Cooperation in 2020, the ministry secured development financing agreements worth $9.8bn during the year; $6.7bn for financing sovereign projects, and $3.1bn in support of the private sector.","On the sidelines of the release of the 2020 annual report titled, ‘International Partnerships for Sustainable Development’, Ministry of International Cooperation launched an interactive website to visualise Egypt’s SDG-aligned development story.
It showcases Egypt’s development through a multilateral lens; illustrating how the Ministry of International Cooperation works to apply the principles of economic diplomacy and foster inclusive partnerships to push Egypt’s development forward in partnership with governments, international development partners, the private sector and civil society.
To measure Egypt’s progress in achieving sustainable development, the website uses various interactive approaches to make it easier for audiences to digest.
In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $100m in agriculture, irrigation, and national supply through the AFD, EBRD, USAID, OPEC Fund for International Development, and bilateral cooperation with Germany.
In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $1.794bn in development financing in support of the transportation sector, with development partners that include the EIB, AFD, EBRD, China, and Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED)."

The funding comes from the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF), a multi-stakeholder financial and capacity building platform, that bridges entrepreneurship, social innovation, and blended capital to create sustainable economic and social returns.

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative. We hope that this go beyond the three windows and be a permanent intiative,” he said.","A total of 32 fledgeling and aspiring local entrepreneurs received N$2.5 million worth of grant funding on Tuesday.

As mentioned in the book ""Summa de Arithmetica"", by the ""father of accounting and bookkeeping"" Luca Pacioli, in 1494, it is a simple calculation in which the rule number is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years required for doubling. Using this rule for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it can be shown that if per capita GDP grows at 1 percent per year, then it will take roughly 70 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today. On the other hand, if per capita GDP grows at 3 percent per year, it will take only a little more than 23 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today.

Thus, even small differences in the growth rate of the economy over long periods of time may lead to dramatically different standards of living for the people of a country. So, what are the characteristics of an economy that make it grow faster than others? What policies can the government take to accelerate the pace of economic growth? Regarding such questions, Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas remarked, ""The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.""

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 acknowledges the importance of economic growth. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has brought in sudden and drastic disruptions that have ravaged the world economy and will most likely produce the greatest rise in global unemployment since World War II. For Bangladesh, the economic fallout from Covid-19 will be multidimensional in nature and massive in magnitude. For example, as of October 2020, real GDP growth for Bangladesh in 2020 has been estimated to be 1.6 percent by the World Bank and 3.8 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Earlier in April, the World Bank had forecasted that on a disaggregated level, real growth in Bangladesh economy in 2020 would be 3.5 percent for the agriculture sector, 2 percent for the industry sector and 3.5 percent for the services sector. At this rate, the agriculture sector would create 0.10 million more jobs, whereas the industry and services sectors would create 0.21 million and 0.9 million less jobs respectively, compared to 2018-19, assuming that employment-to-GDP elasticity would remain equal to that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the level of employment would be equal to that in 2016-17. This suggests that the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 may reduce employment in services and industry sectors, but create jobs in the agriculture sector, which would reverse decades of gradual structural transformation and stall the development of the economy.

Such dismal predictions seem to reflect the ground reality since, as of June 2020, at least 50,000 low-income individuals left Dhaka and returned to their village homes after losing their jobs due to the pandemic.

SDG 8 also asserts the need for decent jobs. Unfortunately, despite the rapid economic growth, Bangladesh has struggled to provide productive employment and decent jobs for its young labour force. In 2017, the youth unemployment rate was as high as 10.6 percent, whereas the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Regrettably, the unemployment rate among the youth who had completed tertiary-level education was 13.4 percent. This implies that the education system in Bangladesh is being unable to endow young people with market-relevant skills. In 2018, the share of the youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) was 26.2 percent in Bangladesh compared to the global average of 21.2 percent. These issues are particularly disconcerting because the country is now at the juncture where it may be able to reap the demographic dividends if it can gainfully employ its enormous young population.

The International Labour Organization has estimated that the fall in working hours in South Asia due to Covid-19 in the first two quarters of 2020 would be equivalent to 161 million full-time 40-hour-per-week jobs. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling has estimated that almost 140 million people in five South Asian countries and 12.37 million in Bangladesh may lose their jobs due to the pandemic. A survey by the Asian Development Bank has shown that the number of online job postings in Bangladesh in April 2020 was only 13 percent of the number of online job postings in April 2019. As of April 2020, 71 percent of urban slum-dwellers and 55 percent of the rural poor had no jobs due to Covid-19.

In the book ""Youth Employment in Bangladesh: Creating Opportunities—Reaping Dividends"", which I co-authored, we put forward a few suggestions for achieving SDG 8 in Bangladesh that are more relevant now in the context of Covid-19. These include: i) creating a database of youth NEET; ii) linking youth with employers; iii) revolutionising the education system so that it can build analytical competence and instil critical thinking skills in students; iv) increasing availability of technology and internet, particularly in the rural areas; v) reforming technical and vocational training to address the current need of industries; vi) ensuring equal employment opportunities for all without discrimination, prejudice or nepotism; vii) improving access to information at national, regional, and local levels; viii) promoting self-employment through entrepreneurship; ix) providing career counselling for the youth from an early stage; x) fostering an enabling environment for female youth; xi) training informal workers; and xii) seeking employment opportunities abroad.

Robeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The fund would be benchmark unaware and applied Robeco’s proprietary SDG assessment framework which screen companies that contribute positively to the SDGs.

The SDGs were a set of 17 goals and 169 targets for government, business and society with the aim to reduce inequality, eradicate poverty and protect the environment.

The fund would be an actively-managed global credit strategy that could invest in opportunities across different segments in the credit market, ranging from investment grade to emerging markets credits to high yield.

Stephen Dennis, head of Robeco Australia, said the launch of the fund in the local market provided investors the opportunity to tap into Robeco’s global expertise in credit investing, and market-leading approach to sustainable investing.

“Local wholesale and institutional investors are increasingly responding to the sustainability demands of their clients and members, and the ability to access the SDG credit income fund is a development that will be welcomed by them,” Dennis said.

September 2020 marked the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the SDGs and Robeco urged the global investment community to do more as part of the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Sustainable investing is not going away; in fact, it’s only going to continue to evolve and attract further investor demand,” Dennis said.

“Investors are in a unique position to direct capital to companies that provide solutions to sustainability challenges.

“Robeco’s focus on this area over a long period of time means we’ve been able to refine our processes, and continue to offer investors products that not only generate market-leading returns, but also contribute on a practical level to the objectives of the UN SDGs.”","Select rating Give it 1/5 Give it 2/5 Give it 3/5 Give it 4/5 Give it 5/5 Cancel ratingRobeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The requested amount, coupled with funds the network hopes to receive from neighbouring municipalities such as Prescott-Russell and the City of Cornwall, as well as members, sponsors and stakeholders, would be enough for the EOAFN to have a $150,000 annual core funding.

EOAFN executive director Tom Manley asked council on Monday to consider a three-year partnership with the organization. The partnership would entail SDG providing the network with a proposed $25,000 a year. The EOAFN strives to promote small-scale agriculture, artisan food processing, agri-tourism, and local food consumption.

The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAFN) is hoping a partnership can be struck with the United Counties of SDG.

“For example, currently (the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs) offers a current program which requires 50 per cent matching funding and without core funding, an organization like EOAM cannot apply for those grants.”

Having core annual funding, Manley said, would allow the EOAFN to have core staff, essential services, networking activities, and training for operators.

“This would make sure that the operators see value in the services and are prepared to pay membership fees to contribute to that core funding,” he said. “It becomes a catch-22 situation — ‘show me the value and I will pay the membership fee,’ but we can’t show you the values without having the core funding.”

According to Manley, some of the value the EOAFN could offer operators include asset mapping, online marketing, promotional activities and regional distribution. This would also lead to the organization of more special events such as farm tours, and local food festivals.

Several councillors were weary of allocating the requested sum, stressing they would rather see a business plan beforehand.

“Personally, I’d rather see a business plan associated with a request of this nature,” said Coun. Carma Williams. “I know you’ve been around for a while — is there any such thing in existence?”

According to Manley, such a plan does exists and can be found on the organization’s website.

“There are so much work to do and so many different aspects of agri-tourism,” said Williams. “It’s very complex and the temptation — from my perspective anyway — is trying to be everything to everybody and meanwhile being nothing to anyone. It can happen.

“I think it’s important to really focus efforts so that actual concrete things can happen. I have more questions with regards with ensuring that the things would actually be accomplished here.”

In order to address Williams’ concerns, Manley told council he would invite SDG to appoint one of its members to serve on the EOAFN’s board.

The decision by SDG council on whether to allocate the funding request is set to be taken during 2021 budget deliberations, set to begin in February.

They said a comprehensive database on flood-hit people should be made for their transplant and effective rehabilitation with intent to attain SDGs within 2030.

The observations were made the virtual dialogue styled 'Relief Support and Agricultural Incentives in Response to COVID-19 and Flood: The Effectiveness of Public Service Delivery'.

The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and Oxfam Bangladesh in partnership with Manab Mukti Sangstha and Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh co-hosted the event.

The experts said the amount of relief and incentives should be fixed following the actual number of affected people rather than the total population of a district.

The dialogue was part of the 'Enhancing the participation of community-based organisations and civil society organisations in democratic governance in Bangladesh' project being implemented by CPD and Oxfam.

Supported by the European Union, the project aims to contribute to the implementation of SDGs by the government in numerous areas.

Monday's programme was mainly based on relief distribution and Covid-19 responses of government organisations in Sirajganj district. It revealed shortages of relief materials and government incentives for flood-affected people compared to the demand in Sirajganj during flooding.

The CPD conducted their research in two sub-districts of Sirajganj, including Sirajganj Sadar and Chauhali.

CPD distinguished fellow Prof Mustafizur Rahman and senior research fellow Towfiqul Islam Khan moderated the programme.

Lawmakers from Sirajganj Prof Dr Md Habibe Millat and Tanvir Shakil Joy, among others, also spoke.

CPD senior research associate Muntaseer Kamal presented a keynote during the webinar.

He said 51 per cent of land and 95 per cent of villages of the district were inundated between the July-August period in the outgoing year.

During the 2017-18 floods, the keynoter said, 1.0 per cent of Aman crops was lost in Sirajganj which might increase notably in the 2020 floods for longevity.

He highlighted government initiatives for flooding and Covid-19 responses, including food assistance, cash assistance of Tk 2,500 and free agri inputs for marooned farmers.

According to the paper, the local administration and government representatives made their best efforts in distributing relief, but the allocation was lower than the actual demand.

There is a general lack of awareness among the local people of the government's hotline services.

The beneficiary selection process was not always participatory due to reasons like a lack of promotion of such initiatives, said the paper. Government data shows 0.3 million and 0.31 million families in Sirajganj got rice assistance and cash assistance respectively, it added.

But field reports found many of the affected families were yet to get help.

A list of 75,000 people was sent to the centre seeking the government's humanitarian assistance of Tk 2500 as a part of its new corona response.

But 65 per cent of them got aid, disclosed the paper. A lack of authentic database of disaster-hit people has been hampering such programmes, it cited.

Mr Joy recognised the need for further focusing on employment generation for vulnerable people rather than depending solely on relief measures. Dr Millat said parliamentarians should be involved more actively in the relief distribution process.

Prof Rahman suggested that telecommunication in char areas like Sirajganj be improved by providing government incentives to telecoms companies to broaden their network facilities.

The CPD suggested making a comprehensive database of flood and corona-hit people for transplant and dynamic relief and incentive distribution which are unavoidable to achieve SDGs.

Oxfam Bangladesh head of economic inclusion and justice Mohammad Soeb Iftekhar made an introductory speech while Manab Mukti executive director Md Habibullah Bahar gave a vote of thanks.

It’s wasn’t quite Christmas, but SDG received quite the generous gift on Dec. 21 — an 84-acre forest, courtesy of Dr. John Macaulay.

The news of the donation was made to council through a formal letter of intent sent from Macaulay. In it, the man wrote he has owned and managed the parcel of land — located off of Robertson Road in Martintown — for about 50 years.

“My reason for wishing to make this donation at this time is that I am now 90 years of age and no longer physically capable of managing this forested land myself, even with help from available resources,” Macaulay stated in his letter. “None of my adult family wishes to take on this responsibility. After my death, it is likely that the land would be deforested and the remarkable biological diversity of the land would be lost.”

The donation would be made through the Canada Ecological Gifts Program and as such, the county would have very little financial obligation relative to the value of the donation. A site visit by the county’s contracted forester — South Nation Conservation — revealed the lot has been well managed, possesses magnificent diversity, and great potential for continued hardwood growth.","Article contentIt’s wasn’t quite Christmas, but SDG received quite the generous gift on Dec. 21 — an 84-acre forest, courtesy of Dr. John Macaulay.

“What I’m asking you today is for permission to go ahead and start a process to look at engaging somebody who is qualified and has experience in this area, knows how to navigate their way around education, school boards and where to get the data,” said Simpson. “The big element of this project I see is working with whoever we’re going to hire and scoping what we’re looking for.”

The creation of the document is key in supporting one of the priorities set in the county’s strategic plan adopted by council in November 2019 — educating children in their communities.

During its Monday meeting, SDG council gave chief administrative officer (CAO) Tim Simpson the green light to develop an advocacy document to promote rural education within SDG.

“Then we would form a group to work with this person in order to develop a document,” said Simpson. “I would certainly hope that it would be in place in the spring or early summer. That would give us time to actually use it going forward.

“This is something we’ve been talking about for years now.”

Several councillors, such as Coun. Jamie MacDonald, gave their support to the initiative

“I think this the best idea for us to move forward, having somebody that is not politically involved but that will bring everyone together,” he said. “It’s not a lot of money for the impact it has on our townships.”

“I think that it will bring all the pieces together,” said Coun. Kirsten Gardner. “It’s nice to have the non-political view on this. Hopefully we will be able to get a consultant that not only knows about education, but also funding formulas that the government uses. I think this is the way and hopefully we will find someone good.”

Although Coun. Allan Armstrong voiced his support for the creation of the document, he did tell council he favored hiring a consultant who did not have any ties to local school boards. This, he argued, would be counterintuitive.

“It would be nice to try to consider someone who is not a former educator or former sitting member of one of the school boards,” he said. “With no disrespect to any of them, but that does skirt the fine line of the possibility of repetition in another coat. As we all spend a lot of time in certain locations you do become sort of familiar and forget the fact that we are looking for a bit of innovation here because we’ve all indicated here we’re not necessarily happy with the education system that we have.

“The same old, same old isn’t quite going to work.”

The staff would certainly appreciate the additional support this would provide.” The county’s short-term sick leave program provides for five days of sick leave paid 100 per cent from the municipality, followed by another 105 days of short-term leave (with a doctor’s note) at 75 per cent pay. New snow plow SDG council approved the purchase of a new snow plow and related equipment at a total cost of $272,829 — slightly under the $275,000 budgeted for it.

Article content The cab and chassis will be acquired from Rush Truck Centres of Canada Ltd. for $133,109, whereas the plow and spreader equipment will be purchased from Gin-Cor Industries at the cost of $139,720. The purchase of the new plow will create a surplus unit which, pending staff’s detailed salt-management review, is expected to be sold via auction. As in previous years, local municipal staff will be provided with the opportunity to test drive the surplus plow should there be interest. Deadline extended Citing concerns over storm sewers, county administration requested the deadline for tenders for the Morrisburg roundabout and streetscape project be extended to Dec. 22. The request was approved by the SDG council. In its report, administration outlined that it had concerns regarding how the layout and location of the storm sewer could create conflict between some of the pipes and maintenance hole elements of the not yet built roundabout. “Staff, in conjunction with the design consultant, determined that the issue could not be quickly resolved without the need for further design investigations,” reads the report. It’s expected that construction of the project should begin in spring 2021. New clerk sworn in SDG council approved a bylaw on Monday in order to confirm Kimberley Casselman as its new clerk on Jan. 1 She will replace retiring clerk Helen Thomson. Casselman began her training alongside Thomson on Dec. 7. “I look forward to retirement, having that second cup of coffee with Don, and be the granny that can help with her grandchildren at a moment’s notice,” Thomson told council, her voice full of emotion. “It’s hard to say goodbye. I’d like to thank the county for the past 42 years — it’s been an honour to work here, it really has.”

Council voted in favour of extending its lease of the Morrisburg court at the cost of $260 per day for 10 days per year. The new lease will extend until Dec. 31, 2023. The county has had to lease the Morrisburg court since 2001, when the administration of provincial offences was downloaded by the province. South Dundas currently owns the property and leases it to the SDG. Emily 9-1-1 goes into 2021 SDG council unanimously agreed to extend the unspent funds from Project Emily 9-1-1 to 2021. This will allow for municipalities to extend the program for another year. “This gives an extra year to put up signage on farm,” said Simpson. “We know this year has been rough on everyone, especially farmers.” Project Emily 9-1-1 strives to create visible signage on agricultural properties in order to assist first responders in identifying specific properties in case of emergency. fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Federal and provincial funding made available to several local farm-based businesses allowed for more food choices among consumers.

Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, the two branches of government invested over $3.5 million in order to assist 700 businesses in the Ontario agri-food sector in establishing or expanding their online presence. It’s hoped the funding will provide consumers with more local food choices when shopping from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Good performance was recorded for all 17 goals, he said today at the virtual launch of the “SDG Indicators, Malaysia, 2019” report — the second report of the country’s SDG indicators published by the Department of Statistics Malaysia.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals based on five focus areas, namely people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The goals are measured according to 247 indicators set at the global level in 2019.

On indicator assessment, Mustapa said for Malaysia, 128 indicators or 52 percent were available while 73 indicators or 29 percent needed to be developed.

“A total of 13 percent or 31 indicators are not available while 15 indicators or six percent are not relevant to Malaysia,” he said.

Mustapa said the national SDG progress status was also measured based on the performance of 108 statistical indicators.

Among aspects that showed positive progress was under the people focus area, with the overall incidence of poverty improving to 5.6 percent (405,441 households) in 2019 from 7.6 percent (525,743 households) in 2016, he said.

Meanwhile, the prosperity focus area showed the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at constant prices grew 3.9 percent in 2019 compared with 3.6 percent in 2018.

“In line with the growth in the digital economy especially in the new normal following Covid-19, the percentage of individuals using the Internet has risen 3.0 percentage points to 84.2 percent in 2019 from 81.2 percent in the preceding year.

“For the Internet usage in the cities and rural areas, they increased 2.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively,” he said.

He added that all elements comprising the five focus areas would be continued in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) after having been incorporated into the country’s developmental policies such as the 11th Malaysia Plan and Shared Prosperity Vision 2030

“In fact, a new approach will be taken under 12MP to deal with poverty through a targeted programme based on local needs across all races.

“This is because the poverty issues differ according to demographics and current situations. The way to handle it must suit the local conditions,” he explained.

According to him, the SDG implementation requires commitment from all quarters to continue the people development agenda.

“Hence the role played by the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia on SDG (APPGM-SDG) is very critical to assist in achieving the Agenda 2030 goals.

“The group, which was established following the Dewan Rakyat approval on Oct 19, 2019, comprises 10 Members of Parliament including me,” he said.

Mustapa said APPGM-SDG was involved in SDG at the Parliamentary level by conducting local issue mapping activities and recommending solution ideas.

In the first phase, the group made field visits to 10 parliamentary constituencies in four states.

Next year, he said, APPGM-SDG would do the same programme in 20 parliamentary areas, especially in states that were not visited in 2020.

“The implementation of SDG goals is a continuation from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended in 2015.
